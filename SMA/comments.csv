It&#39;s businessman mentality where making money is the only thing that they care, and the rest is none of their concern. Most people can&#39;t leave the job because they are held hostage due to the financial commitment they need to meet."
1,"These companies cannot possibly drop lower or can they, it is just JOKE..."
2,"Fun fact for us Americans: the state of Georgia only has a Department of Labor in spirit. They have ZERO employment laws/protections/procedures in place. Everything defaults to the FLSA as far as any &quot;protections&quot; go.<br>If your billion dollar employer just stops paying you for some shifts, your SOL on the state level and have to toss your hat into federal level procedure."
3,"A lot of good advice here, not just in terms of Blizzard and the greater gaming industry, but corporate work culture in general. HR is not your friend, but if you&#39;re at a company that actually gives a shit, they might be helpful. America is so far behind in labor rights and work culture health. We could be the greatest country in the world but we give so many freedoms to the worst kinds of corporate overlords. It&#39;s so backwards and I hate it."
4,"Every piece of new information comes out about blizzard is just so painful to watch, the empire is actually built with human ashes, for years and years."
5,bifrost op af
6,I think I did that 30 steps list thing in school once.
7,"Nerdds are the most selfish hateful deranged people on the planet. That is why they are nnerds, forget that cliche that they are misunderstood sweet people with a kind and sweet soul."
8,"Played Blizzard games for decades. It&#39;s not the same anymore. Nowadays I just spent more of my free time on my work and industry related hobbies, Kuberenetes, DevOps etc."
9,‚ÄúThey fired all those people. That‚Äôs talent you are never going to get back‚Äù correction thats talent they don‚Äôt want back. Welcome to the new world of AI going to take 90 percent of your jobs and do it fast 24 hours a day and more efficiently. And one less ideologically driven rainbow flag virtue signaling person there to ruin the gaming industry. People with rainbow flags are the same type of people that hang up blue thin line flags. You might think you are different but believe me you are equal zealots.
10,Why are jobs getting so effing bad
11,"Hearing this really felt like the Gambit-Guy from Destiny 2 drawing your Job as a Dev: Uuuh, Blizzard! Really sad what this Company has become"
12,Politics are always part of big corporates.

14,"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KGQSTDm5ois&amp;t=799"">13:19</a> Regarding firing people who been at a company 13-15 years - if I&#39;m brutally honest: I wonder if useful company knowledge doesn&#39;t start to plateau after like ~¬†7 years, in some cases.  And if there&#39;s an annual % raise - salaries can get very high after +10 years.<br><br>I&#39;m starting to feel it myself: after many years at the same company. I have learned a lot but since teams and systems have changed it&#39;s not necessarily even applicable anymore and me saying &quot;we tried this 6 years ago and it didn&#39;t work&quot; would harm more than it helps."
15,"To be honest, I&#39;m on the fence regarding if &quot;Devs are rockstars, QA isn&#39;t&quot; is horrible or not.<br>I&#39;ve worked as a dev for media companies where we were basically told &quot;content is the rockstar, tech isn&#39;t&quot;, and we accepted it as perfectly reasonable.<br>BUT this was said by another developer. It would&#39;ve felt less OK if was said by a content creator who wasn&#39;t part of the tech organization. <br>Secondly - this was said in a meeting with the entire tech organization, and we were kind of a separate entity to the content organization. It would&#39;ve felt weird if someone name one of our many tech teams as &quot;rockstars&quot; .<br><br>Allthough ... if we&#39;re crass, I&#39;ve heard it said once - when our Platform/devOps team were considering making a change that would break a profitable application because the app devs were slow. And some boss basically told em &quot;The application is the rockstar, the end users are what matters, not your platform&quot;"
16,&quot;I named it bifrost because it was a bridge&quot; bro is prophecizing his own shit
17,I pressed the like button just because I heard about your drug addiction on the other video and now I am afraid you might go back to that if I don‚Äôt press the like button and your channel doesn‚Äôt become a successful one.
18,"The way you fix the middle management and festering pockets, is you implement some principles already discovered by others out there in business.  The CEO going down in the trenches was part of the problem, he&#39;s trying to fix everything himself when he needed systems in place to keep things fixed internally.  The outside firm wont work as well as having the internal systems in place to fix things.  Basically it&#39;s a problem the CEO is likely causing, but he&#39;s causing it from honest mistakes in his management style.  A few honest mistakes up top, trickle down a few levels and create festering pockets.  Also, it had the problem of being &quot;Blizzard&quot;, any rockstar place to work can have these issues because people are willing to tolerate more to work there... which further causes the problems you&#39;re trying to avoid.  In normal companies, they&#39;ll just leave, and toxicity is lessened because the pocket implodes easier after skilled people leave."
19,"Good managers are rarer than platinum and diamonds. <br>My best managers insulated us from the bullshit raining down from corporate, got us the resources to get our jobs done, and trusted us to get the job done."
20,this made me delete battle net
21,"I still get Indeed emails for jobs. Every three months I would get Activision Q&amp;A job testing postings. This is for CoD as it was Eden Prairie. In 2015, this was $15.96 with the most ridiculous qualifications. I later talked to the people that quit and I understand why a Camera ended up in a restroom."
22,"As a person who works in QA (worked on Torchlight 3, Nioh 2, New World, Weird West, Song of Nunu among others), all this resonates deeply with me. QA is treated like trash both by management and gamers. I&#39;m so glad I test software instead of games now."
23,"perfect example of a dev from a legacy studio that left while it was on the heels of a sour release, and made a masterpiece: Nate Purkeypile after Fallout 76. His game just came out, its on steam and its called The Axis Unseen."
24,"Something about the guy complaining how HR block him from working for 3 months sounds dodgy. The non-compete clause doesn&#39;t activate suddenly its active at all times for all jobs that have noncompete clause. However, a company can&#39;t stop you from working for a competitor unless you are carrying extremely top secret company information. That tweet conversation is leaving out stuff."
25,"I mean, they did this to us in home and careers in 6th grade.  I‚Äôm 40 now:"
26,"Uhhh in our studies (at Uni) we all learn that (from Management to IT, especially in IT Management) that QA is at the same level like Software Engineering, means they&#39;re QA Engineers. Yes it&#39;s engineering!! The same we have Software Engineering. And hell yeah! Once in Social Engineering you kinda SMELL THAT DIRTY SH1T! üòÜ Oh the language told me immediately he&#39;s govieee üòÜ No this is illegal in European Law, as well as EU law, but keep in mind UK is not EU, UK is now America. YES! Knowing the diff between work and job is so incredible!"
27,Another thing is I can‚Äôt take a easier job that would be nicer because the judge isn‚Äôt gonna change my child support payment if I take a lower paying job so watch out for that shit
28,"You&#39;re a tester bro. I replace you with a 12 year old, My friends at EA games made 10 a hour too for testing. welcome to the world of testing."
29,"i love listening to thor just talk to someone one to one, and not chat. I love his shorts, but this long talk is super convenient to listen to when im doing other things and listening along"
30,Wish Prime didn&#39;t derail the conversation every 10 seconds. So annoying.
31,In a lot of countries here we have unions that will help negotiate for you against a troublesome employer. They have lawyers aswell. Have had friends who have gotten help against both state run employers and private. No system is perfect but your system seems f***ked up. Esp with healthcare insurance often tied into your employment. We need good regulation esp for large companies to protect employees.
32,This is ao sad. I spent so many happy hours in Azeroth. I&#39;m saddened to know its creators had such a miserable working situation.
33,"I hear all this... and I came out of it rather liking Mike. But I neither forgive nor absolve him. It was his job to know what was going on in a company that was, and I mean this without hyperbole, working people to death. The EA merger didnt save them, the Microsoft merger wont save them. Quitting or unionization are the only plausible options I can think of - but hey, i never worked there"
34,"UK law means that if you are not employed by a company and they are not paying you, a non-compete clause is very very difficult to enforce ... as in you can go an work for a direct competitor and there will be no consequences at all .."
35,"&quot;Get everything in writing&quot; best piece of advice ever. However, i worked for a company where HR NEVER put anything in writing, even in follow up emails where i would say &quot;hey to go off our meeting earlier, i just wanted to confirm that you requested me to do X, please confirm&quot;. My hr manager never responded, when it is near impossible to get anything in writing its time to leave, they are setting you up to be fired with cause. Dont let them."
36,"Man his experience at Blizzard is identical to the experience of working for EB Games... The only times they fight to keep you was when you tried to leave and it would be offers of 3 - 3.5% increase to base salary but the field I&#39;m in, the market rate is literally 79% higher than they were offering... As well as them having a super toxic leadership body. My first job hop from them was 32% increase to what they gave me and I went on to get poached twice more. I&#39;m now leading a team + 245% increase to what I was on working with them and the work is EASIER because the leadership LISTENS.<br><br>A lot of the decisions made came down to: Well the analysts are all saying do X and we&#39;ll improve our position but my gut says do this instead so I&#39;m going to.<br>Surprise pikachu face doesn&#39;t remotely cover their shock at shit not working."
37,"I had work with a guy, this person always try gain my trust. And for my experience, if someone  really wants your trust, don&#39;t trust them. <br>But the way he tries, is always tell me small part of high level meetings, try make  me feel also important. <br>And what he does is in the wrong way as possible. <br>One time he told me what a guy told to HR when he left the company. <br>This conversation with HR, should be confidential, HR never should pass this information forward. <br>And he never, never told me about the conversation. <br>I know how frustrating the guy was with the company, why he  left the company.  What he told about other guy. <br>HR is not your friend, they are trained sons...<br>They will lie to you without any hesitation <br>Everything tell to HR will use against you"
38,"holy fuck, this is wild to listen to"
39,"For those that don&#39;t know about California, it&#39;s a shithole state that nobody can afford to live in. Don&#39;t go live here. Don&#39;t visit here."
40,"Wait, I thought he left because they never made a formal contract for his position change. They can&#39;t enforce a NCC he did not sign. What in the f-"
41,&quot;You get festering pockets&quot;<br><br>I think you&#39;re describing an abscess. Or possibly a cyst. Which is a pretty apt description of middle-management.
42,@48 mins now I understand why you said you were an experienced cage fighter on linked in.
43,On several occasions I had devs contact me in QA and they were genuinely trying to resolve an issue i reported with the game. And every time the devs trying to communicate got in trouble because managment demanded that QA be isolated from the rest of the company
44,They had to ban Gallows humor at Activision because everyone in QA was coping with so much &quot;I&#39;d rather be dead&quot; &quot;kill me now&quot; comments that it actually was making managment uncomfortable.
45,Passion creates good products.  MBAs only take and creates collapses.  Our power as consumers is simply to only promote the passionate.  Boycott the MBAs!
46,Thor used Bifrost.  No way :P
47,Sounds so much better at 0.75 speed. Plus I get more time to enjoy this.
48,"So in the USA, and UK, you cannot contact away your rights, in the US you can get a noncompete claws that says you cannot open a business in this field for x years, but thay cannot stop you from opening a business period. And in 99% of those cases there is a question if the companys practices and methods are used, there was a case from Pappa John&#39;s and a local pizza place in my home town of a cook opening a pizza restaurant, but it was found that not of Pappa jons &quot;protected practices&quot; were infringed on cus the dude made entirely different styles of pizza and Cal zones, so now pappajhons has the pappadea"
49,"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KGQSTDm5ois&amp;t=887"">14:47</a> that makes a lot of sense, so I wonder wtf happened with Starfield."
50,"Was not the round layoffs Microsoft did mostly QA?<br><br>Watching this I am so glad I live where I live, yes we have issues in Norway, but it&#39;s incredibly difficult to fire someone on the spot and have them leave on the same day, unless you have done something illegal (and even then it can be hard) it&#39;s really hard to fire someone, and if you do you need a good reason and a 3 month notice (at the minimum)."
51,&quot;weird military brochacho shit&quot; üòÇ
52,"A little late to the party but this was exactly my experience from my time at IBM. It&#39;s so unbelievably similar that hearing this legit caused an anxiety spike that I haven&#39;t had in a long, long time. I swear, the next person who says &quot;boil the ocean&quot; is getting their teeth knocked out."
53,US Labor Laws need a massive overhall and/or employee rights and protections massively expanded.
54,HR clearly didn‚Äôt know what was up üòÇ
55,"&quot;HR is there to protect the company&quot;<br><br>Universally true but I e found at small companies where HR is often handled by the accountant etc, you either get someone who is worse than corporate HR, or someone really looking out for the team. Ive never had a bad experience with the second type but you should still always work with them as if theyre not an ally of its something big."
56,"I think the Jeff Kaplans, Ben Brodes and Miyazakis of the world shouldn&#39;t have to worry about profit. The people who hire them and assign them to direct the projects are the ones who should worry about profit.<br><br>The decision to put Miyazaki in charge on more soulslikes at From goes like this: &quot;This guy LOVES something that we think will be profitable. Let HIM be the one who does it.&quot;"
57,I always hated those task lists with the end being something like leave the room because technicallt you should have done all the steps up to that point before leaving...<br><br>They want you to leave the room but technically thats not what they asked you.
58,I didn‚Äôt know who mike was
59,"In respect to HR.. i&#39;m living and working in Denmark.. HR are only there for you as long as the cost of your problem are less than the cost of letting you leave..<br><br>Unions are there for you, we have no minimum wages but we still got higher lowest wage jobs than US, because of Unions.. we got around 12 month of maternity leave pr kid where both parents got mandated a big part of it, we got 5-6 weeks paid vacation a year, and we are not dependent on a job for good healthcare and unemployment benefits are liveable, in general we got a trial period of 3 month, here they can fire you for many things but they still need to have some basis for it.. you can also just quit without notice.. after the periode they need to have a good reason to kick you out or pay your next 3 month full salary..<br><br>I got a panic attack at my former job where i dropped and broke parts for 250k dkk, that was enough to fire me, but i still got the 3 month paid salary.. üòÖ sick leaves are not a reasonable ground to fire you even after 6-12 month, but the government also pay most of the salary back.."
60,Sorry i dont trush him truth will come out soon
61,"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KGQSTDm5ois&amp;t=1333"">22:13</a> HR for the company? Absolutely."
62,sounds familiar my uncle worked in Kaufland in the butcher/freeze departmend and then they wanted to reduce the departmend they invited the whole departemend and in a room and got 5 &quot;lawyers! talking to them to quit themself and the people all quit because they talked them into it. my uncle is very pissed about that now because then he didint knew that he would get a extraction paymend if he didnt signed the shit himself.
63,"To be perfectly honest, there is some magic in how Blizzard handled things and one should take a lot of advice from their direction. Even if some of it doesn&#39;t match how some people think things should be done nowadays.<br><br>Blizzard is still the golden standard that created unforgettable games that we love. Never downplay the machine of that. You don&#39;t know what parts of it were critical to the whole."
64,"In 2009 living in southern California was not that bad when it came to rent and buying. It sucked if you&#39;re one of the victims of 2008 housing market crash. Other than that 1500+ were luxury rentals. Just google 2009 average rent and its around $800. You could rent a house around 1,000-1,200 during that time that was in a decent neighbor hood."
65,"in the uk, you need to work somewhere for2 years before you have basically any rights... but non-compete&#39;s are not enforcable."
66,The part about not being rockstars the devs are is so much like Amazon most GMS won&#39;t say it out loud to everyone in those Fulfillment centers (which I currently work at) but ours said it to all of everyone in Inbound and said &quot;You guys make us lose money we make no money from you guys which is why we don&#39;t give you as much time off and more mandatory overtime so outbound can make us money&quot; like shit that part that Thor talked about made me remember that whole talk our building gm gave and it sucks so much
67,I guess a tacobell dorito locos tacos buttplug is roughmanly
68,"There&#39;s qa, and then there&#39;s qa devs. There&#39;s a huge difference between the two. Either way, qa should be paid well, they&#39;re so so vital.<br><br>I&#39;ve always argued that every developer is QA. You have to do the testing yourself and everything. Otherwise you just pass off turds."

71,&quot;you are an adult if you can say &#39;yeah sure&#39; and people know you mean &#39;fuck off&#39;&quot;

73,reminds me of my teachers in highschool on their exams that would give clear directions to just put your name on the paper and turn it in. Not many people can follow simple directions.
74,LOL
75,LOL
76,Thor is taking me back to the bad place with this reminiscing.  I‚Äôm delighted that Thor learned all the right lessons from our experience and is making such a great difference in the industry.  What a class act.
77,I‚Äôm currently a qu at a very prestigious company and I felt every single thing here man..<br><br>I have a fucking computer science degree and I get treated like shit even tho I‚Äôm constantly pulling all nighters bc I would never make deadlines otherwise.<br><br>All I want is to get out and move to dev bc not only would that essentially double my salary but maybe I wouldn‚Äôt feel like the lowest guy on the totum poll
78,Played d2 for thousands of hours d3 was pretty good not nearly as replayable in my opinion. Didn&#39;t even bother with d4 heard microtransactions were involved and just assumed it was a cash grab. Wish they made a d2 style game but 20 or 30 acts instead of 5 id play that forever. Lord of destruction could be a seasonal or yearly release instead of a 1 time expansion.
79,"Be a slave or be fired! Only the board members matter, not the product, not the morals, not the customer. Gotta love Citizens United. United as a corp and anything less isn&#39;t a Real citizen. Just human serfs..."
80,This was a common test for first year lab students to assure we didn&#39;t fail to follow directions and cause a fire or something. This sounds like almost the exact task we were given in college.
81,"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KGQSTDm5ois&amp;t=583"">9:43</a> That sounds just like racism!"

84,"What he should of done was Contact ACAS (Advisory, Conciliation and Arbitration Service).<br><br>Filing the complaint does nothing, The investigator is raised and paid by the employer, therefore is complicit with the employer and is therefore a conflict of interest."
85,I&#39;ve heard from the managers themselves that this stopped happening quite a while back. I used to work as a gm myself around 2018.If you tried to contact the higher ups as a game master you would be doing nothing other than messaging the managers so I don&#39;t know when the practice stopped or if the game masters ever had access to Mike Morhaim but I doubt even the current devs have access to the higher ups at this point. They would probably talking to some manager about the situation. I don&#39;t recommend working for Blizzard unless you&#39;re desperate for work in which case have your resume going around and find a better place to work.
86,if stalin ran a game company
87,This guy has to go to court for this he will win so big
88,Whiney men who never worked a real day in their life complaining like women is so 2024
89,They are talking about warcraft 1-2 like it was bigger than Nintendo at that time
90,You&#39;re insane if you think $10.50/he was bad for a 20 something in the 90s. California was/is the problem.
91,This is why I stopped supporting western video games.
92,"At least in Belgium (probably EU &amp; probably UK), any activated non compete is paid in full for its duration."
93,"Ouch. That story about &quot;Go home. And you&#39;re taking tomorrow off too.&quot; one about 19 minutes in hits way too close to home. I&#39;ve honestly found if I get used to like a 70+ hour work week, once I finish that big push and get time to relax at all... I don&#39;t know what to do with myself. I can&#39;t relax at that point, it&#39;s just frustrating to not be productive at all hours of the day, playing a game to relax just feels stressful because nothing is getting done. So yeah, I get it, probably more than I&#39;d like to.<br><br>For the rest of it before that though, the thing about blizzard having lost the magic, but having been the reason why you got into programming? Yeah. Blizzard was my main thing too, it&#39;s why I became a game dev, and yet, by the time I actually got to be a dev... Blizzard had already fallen. It&#39;s sad to think of it, but I would have done anything 20 years ago to work at Blizzard. If they offered me a job today, I would not only say no, I&#39;d laugh in their face and say oh heeeeell no, and I&#39;d record it and blast it out on every social media I could find. It&#39;s... kinda painful to realize that in the time it took for me to get the skills I needed, the thing I aspired to just basically withered and died in the meantime.<br><br>But that&#39;s why I make my own stuff now. The industry changed a lot after WoW proved you could make more money than most countries&#39; national GDP, and large corporations started trying to chase that in the way they normally do without understanding that bringing quality content works better than leaving behind a dried up, empty husk of a game studio.<br><br>...I&#39;m already ranting here as it is, on a month old video so no one&#39;s going to see this anyway, but yeah, if you&#39;re here, why not - a personal story: when I was working at Spicy Rocket, my boss learned EA was responsible for screwing over like half of his favourite game franchises by purchasing them, firing the &quot;expensive&quot; people who knew what they were doing, and then having people buy the next 2 or so installments which degraded in quality rapidly, and they kept doing it. This is how I got an addition to my contract that explicitly stated that if EA ever purchased us, no one else, just EA specifically, then all of our intellectual property immediately gets handed over to me personally, along with enough money to restart the company under a new name so I could re-hire everyone on the old team back. Never happened, and due to a... terrible issue that is its own story, the studio went under shortly after, but it amuses me to this day that I explicitly had a &quot;fuck you EA&quot; clause in my contract.<br><br>...If only Blizzard had the same thing for when Activision bought them. Alas, hindsight is 20/20. All you can do is make your own studio and make something great instead today instead of mourning what once was. Shame it&#39;s not that easy in practice, but it&#39;s either that or just accept game development as a concept is dead, and I&#39;m not willing to concede that point, and thankfully many others don&#39;t seem to be either."
94,For the record: I subbed because this video! This should be a mandatory watch before starting the work market!
95,I listen to you guys while coding lol
96,"I originally clicked the video because I thought this was the Rollercoaster Tycoon guy. Still fantastic information. <br><br>I personally quit a job where I was promised a promotion for months and wasn&#39;t given it. I then told upper management if I wasn&#39;t given the promised promotion by a certain day that I would quit. When that day rolled around after my shift ended I walked to my boss and handed her my notice of resignation. She continued to give me promises it would happen in the future, and was asked to stay. I didn&#39;t.<br><br>I was one of three people left in the department after layoffs and others quitting due to the increased workload. I was pulling 70-80 hour workweeks over the course of six days. I wasn&#39;t asking for a pay raise, as due to the hours I was working I was actually making more than my direct superiors who were technically two levels above me as the middle management position for my department had been open for over a year. I just picked up the work of the management position as I was the best in the department and the most willing to give my time.<br><br>The role I wanted was salaried, and come to find out, where I was at the time had regulations that salaried workers putting in a certain amount of overtime over their salaried hours were required to be fairly compensated. The company just refused to pay that increase, or hire another person to reduce the number of hours I was working as my salary + their pay would have still been more than what they were paying me in overtime. Hourly workers were not given any benefits, but salaried persons were required by law to receive them. The two remaining people came in the next day and handed in their resignations as well because they weren&#39;t going to deal with the company increasing their workload any more as they weren&#39;t willing to do what I was doing, leaving our entire department unstaffed.<br><br>Three months later there was a huge fire as a piece of equipment I was maintaining ended up catching fire because nobody was doing it anymore. I had just done it because the person hired to maintain and clean all the equipment in our department and a few others was laid off because the company figured they could just make the rest of the employees do the job instead of paying someone to do it. The replacements that got moved over from other departments apparently weren&#39;t given a thorough explanation of the cleaning process as on the floor underneath the equipment where it was powered gunk would slowly build up over time and it never got cleaned out. Cleaning that specific area required someone to turn off the machine as it ran at very high temperatures and stayed on 24/7. Cooling took an hour, and then the whole machine had to be moved. All the internals were easy as you just had to use the machines self cleaning process, so that&#39;s probably all that was done every day. In the end the company had to end up temporarily shut down the whole location, losing millions in revenue, and pay hundreds of thousands in machines and repairs just because they refused to hire more people or just pay more to promote me.<br><br>Corporations are bad because you aren&#39;t anything to them. The job of a publicly traded corporation is to spend as little as possible while taking as much money as possible from consumers. You don&#39;t pay a nice person forty million a year because they will end up costing the company more money in being nice to employees. Instead you hire a douchebag for sixty million a year because they will save the company eighty million by making the most ruthless and predatory decisions possible."
97,"As a kid that&#39;s what I wanted as well was to grow up to be a game dev maybe for blizzard.  I&#39;m glad it didn&#39;t work out yikes.  It&#39;s pretty sad the only job I&#39;ve ever been treated decent was a warehouse job sigh.  Why do bosses have to be jerks?  Happy workers get more done I&#39;m convinced of it.  As long as there is a culture of working not screwing around.  I think bosses being tyrants makes people resentful and sluggish on purpose.  <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KGQSTDm5ois&amp;t=1500"">25:00</a> I remember being downgraded at my job to make room for a new person to do what I had been doing.

102,"I work at Amazon in Logistics. Too many problems for a YouTube comment, but us employees cannot trust anyone. Management is constantly asking us to do things either illegal or against company policy that could lead to immediate termination if anyone saw. And are constantly asking us to put our jobs and safety at risk to make their day easier or state we are being insubordinate and will take us to HR (they are friends with HR). <br><br>I fight the best I can using as much policy and law to defend to help improve myself and coworkers situation until I can finally get out.

114,"Without QA, the devs are nothing. From the gamer side, if QA doesn&#39;t get paid properly to do a good job, the game will fail, complaints will abound, and the devs won&#39;t have anything but more issues as well. They can be rock stars, sure, but without a good sound team, a rock star is just standing on a stage not being properly heard by anyone. [This is not a rag on devs themselves. It&#39;s a rag on the managers who think this way and companies who treat QA like they&#39;re easily replaceable]."
115,"If you have QA unionization... developers turn into the QA team.<br>Developers arent good at QA... and with QA responsibilities they also wont be very good developers either.<br>They will be stricken with burn out, fatigue, and stress which will obfuscate their ability to do their job effectively<br><br>Yes, QA is important TO CONSUMERS.

Key HR events in my life: forced management to give raises to junior staff, intervene to protect good manager from bad clique, explained me the real reason I was fired and assured my rights were respected. In each case they protected the company incidentally helping me."
122,I&#39;m not convinced that non compete and they way they used it was legal. This dude needs a labor lawyer. If he has receipts there isn&#39;t much Blizzard can do.

130,Always remember HR isn&#39;t there for you. They are there to save face for the company. They will make you feel good by telling you they will get to the bottom of the matter when in reality you are the bottom of the matter to them and they are planning their qualms with you or your work ethic.
131,"Chris Sayers, if he can at all prove any of this and it&#39;s not just hearsay, has a fairly easy UCL Claim for a lawsuit against Blizzard under the idea that this was an &quot;unfair&quot; business practice. Depriving him of the potential for monetary gain for a quarter of a year, is within their right with the Non-Compete Claus of their contract, but only in the situation that he was treated fairly. They, in writing, said he wasn&#39;t promoted. This directly is conflicting with the idea that he had to sign a new contract to obtain the new position. Even if the contract directly stated no increase of pay or benefits would be provided, using that contract to leverage a Claus within it could easily be seen in a courtroom as an unjust and unfair abuse and he could be entitled to compensation.<br><br>&quot;Unfair&quot; in this type of legal claim is defined clearly as: ‚Äúoffends established public policy, that is immoral, unethical, oppressive, unscrupulous, or substantially injurious to consumers, or that has an impact on the victim that outweighs defendant‚Äôs reasons, justifications, and motives for the practice.‚Äù<br>Essentially, Blizzard lawyers would have to prove to the courtroom that they denied him livelihood for a justifiable reason, and Sayer&#39;s legal would have to prove the opposite is true.<br><br>First though, he&#39;s gotta have real evidence of the contract he signed, and of the misconduct of the company. A Twitlonger quite literally will do nothing but garner public attention."

We had the same speech of how we are all replaceable by a higher up from Bethesda when the game wasn&#39;t doing well. They never wanted to pay people so they would hire people for a year, let the contract run out. wait 6 months and try to hire them again to get out of paying healthcare and fair wages.

147,"I worked managing I.T. professionals for nearly a decade.  My approach to management was based on acknowledging 2 simple truths.<br><br>First, the employees were NOT there for ME... rather, I was there for THEM.  I was there to give them training, to give them resources, to organize their tasks, etc.  It was my job to make their job as easy as possible and assist them in every way possible in order to get more productivity from them.  It was my job to &quot;have their backs&quot;.<br><br>Second, happy and inspired workers are the best workers.  The more freedom and encouragement I gave them, the better they would perform and the more productive they would be.  If work seemed more like play, then they would play hard, which really meant they were working hard.<br><br>Rather than me dictating steps, policies and procedures my staff were invited to create them together as a team.  After all, they were the experts in their job and duties, they knew best how to make things more efficient.  My role was merely to referee, edit and critique, to offer suggestions and ideas - to be their &quot;QA&quot; as it were - and send it back to them to be reworked if I thought they could do better.<br><br>Turnover was almost non-existent in my department.  The few turnovers I had moved on to very lucrative opportunities at much bigger organizations that no one could possibly pass up and that I applauded and congratulated them on.  They had earned it through their hard work which helped pad their professional portfolio.  In seeing me cheer on their success rather than grumble about losing talent and take on a paranoid attitude of &quot;who else are we going to lose?&quot; the remaining staff were even more inspired to work harder.<br><br>I don&#39;t say that to brag like I was some great manager.  It&#39;s simply how I felt a manager SHOULD manage.  EVERY manager.  How anybody should do it.  Even the most &quot;mediocre&quot; manager.  I was amazed at how few of my peers took this approach.  Most treated their staff like &quot;rank and file&quot;, &quot;you&#39;re lucky to work here&quot;, &quot;you can be replaced at any time&quot;, etc.  They weren&#39;t treated as the exceptionally valuable asset they were.  As a result, their productivity was low and their turnover was high.  As compared to my peers at competing facilities, the ratio of I.T. staff to users, nodes, applications, servers and devices at my facility was roughly half of theirs.  That is, we were capable of carrying twice the workload.  The key difference was, I had &quot;free range&quot; staff while my peers kept theirs in cages or on a tight leash.<br><br>I don&#39;t think it&#39;s rocket science.  I really don&#39;t understand why so many managers let ego (&quot;I&#39;m your boss and thus I&#39;m superior!&quot;) get in their way."

152,"Dude this is something we did in 4th grade, we we&#39;re told to read the instructions first and the last step was &quot;Don&#39;t do anything mentioned above, raise your hand and state you have finished&quot; or something along those lines. How can they use an elementary school test to determine who does and doesn&#39;t keep their job, that&#39;s insane!"

154,"I don&#39;t know how to reconcile the claim that Mike Ybarra didn&#39;t know, with the admission that he was roped in on certain problems. As soon as Mike got roped into any given problem, does it not behoove him to identify why he was insulated from that problem before someone skipped the chain of command? I don&#39;t think you can claim to be insulated after it has been brought to your attention that you are, in fact, being insulated from these types of issues."
155,"This is a corporation thing, not just a game Dev thing."
156,"Yep, what some people think HR is, that&#39;s the union."
157,"One thing I will always remember at one of my ex place work was the ceo of the company telling me that : &quot;Sickness does not exist, it&#39;s just an excuse to grab the money of my company without having to work&quot; ; 2 days later he came to work and contaminate all of us with covide"
158,I understand that Blizzard is a shitty company and there has been much evidence to prove that but as someone who&#39;s worked in corporate environment for over 13 years in both USA and UAE I can confirm that lots of people get deluded about what they are being told and start thinking they got promoted while its not the case. It&#39;s clearly this guy got shafted but a good chunk of the reason might be his own delusions.
159,"Dude, non-competes are crazy. When I was in highschool, I learned that if you quit or are fired as an IT you would be escorted out and paid the week which made some sense to me. But to prevent someone from working for 90 days is insane. I&#39;m glad the FTC has been trying to put a stop to it."
160,Can we just acknowledge for a moment that in this video there are things passing right through Prime&#39;s head?
161,"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KGQSTDm5ois&amp;t=1500"">25:00</a> This is just crazy. That is not the norm in the IT industry. If we ask someone, because they are especially good at it, to do something that pays less, we don&#39;t pay them less. And we thank them profusely for letting us corner them in that role for our lack of planning. And promise and follow through on transitioning them as soon as possible (because we want them to actually do the thing we are paying them for at some point.) At least that is how I would handle this within my teams."
162,Every job ive had the workers were the issue lol.  Its proven that 10% of the workers do like 90% of the work.  Meaning 90% if people are lazy as..  then they blame management lol.  And i used to agree but its hard to when i watch them do nothing half the day ü§£<br><br>I think companies need to spend more time making the job comfortable.  And workers to spend more time trying to actually do a good job.
163,So I use to work QA for a large software suite. I can understand why Engineers looked down on QA because there were a lot of dumbasses there. All the good QA guys who were great at scaling their software testing suite together usually were fought over by the engineers.
164,the badges story is abhorrent. Maybe it is because I am german. But that reminds me of NS-Germany. They had people wear badges based on their status and ethnicity and this was to create an othering of &quot;lower class&quot; people
165,"Really cool chat. I just cant believe how you say AGS is so good - amazon is known in our industry as one of the worst places to work as an engineer (yes im one too, 25+ years).<br>AGS has also completely failed at making anything close to a successful game because they arent gamers and have no clue what gamers want (despite us telling them very loudly nonstop). IE: NW = dead game, and all of us love it and wish it would be successful, but its dead and hasnt utilized any of its potential precisely because AGS are such braindead (&amp;@#(*$&amp;@#(*$&amp;........

172,"As a recovered AAA developer, who also started in QA...  Holy PTSD flashbacks. üòÇ"
173,"It&#39;s incredible what good or even decent management can do for a company. I work in an arena and the management team we had before they were let go would never be caught working front of house dealing with all the nightly bullshit. Instead they would just tell people what they&#39;re failing at without ever trying to investigate why it&#39;s happening. Staff weren&#39;t trained in a consistent way and the pay increase for taking a supervisory role was laughable when tips more than made up for it anyway. <br>A lot has changed, I actually have a lot of respect for my new bosses who&#39;ve been a great help as I&#39;ve transitioned to management myself. <br>Just small things like not having to worry about getting interrogated when I call in sick once or twice a year, or mistakes being used as teaching moments instead of being written up or sent home takes away so much of the anxiety that was always constant with some jobs. <br><br>Also as someone who fell for the &quot;we&#39;re gonna promote you soon&quot; line meanwhile already taking on the tasks (Rona) . 100% Always get the documentation first before taking on any extra duties. I never did get that raise before I eventually quit when they stopped our commission program."
174,American work culture dude. Fuck that.
175,"The only experience I had was with my first company using me like a tool. Shredding me away. No chance of been taking over after I would have finished my education. Not giving me enough help with my final project even. I pushed myself passing my class out of my own power. My instructor told me: &quot;Yeah we will celebrate your success after some time, so things can saddle.&quot; Never heard of him again. Hope my new job will get better..."
176,"if you get promise a promotion, get that shit in writing right then."
177,"Actually, in the UK that is not legal. It might be in the US, but it is not anywhere in Europe."
178,"If there were loads of people going through this and that email system in place, how did Mike not know?<br><br>Feels to me like Thor is looking at Mike with rosevtinted glasses?"
179,"Blizzard inspired me to go into game development, so I went into game art.  I got a Bachelor&#39;s in Game art and I was never able to turn it into a job, I wanted to work at blizzard since I was a literal child I can&#39;t tell at this point if it was a blessing or a curse I didn&#39;t get the job..."
180,IMHO location based pay increases are fine if the company wants you to be in a certain location.
181,"The Ben Brode is the worst example ever, I used to play Hearthstone everyday just to have nothing, it felt dissapointing so I left. Recently returned and now it is more free to play than ever, Ben Brode had a pay to win format that hurted it."
182,"I think the easiest way to think of reputation is basically just chips. And the more good you do, the more chips you get. And the when you do something wrong, people don&#39;t care, because you have loads of chips saved up. But that good will isn&#39;t an unlimited resource, because you only gained so many chips."

189,I literally weep for people who work in air conditioned spaces sitting down all day. I have worked on my feet repairing AC units on a roof in 100+ degree weather and I don&#39;t know how you guys do it. I take lifts 40 feet in the air to mount conduit but dang... If I had to sit at a desk instead... Idk if I could even handle it. My buddy out of state works for a pipeline and he has to live away from his family onsite until the job is finished. But that is nothing compared to what you have described here. People were fired over an aptitude test? That is absurd. Nobody should ever be fired ever for any reason. I weep for you.
190,"I&#39;ve never worked in game development, but I&#39;ve experienced a similar level of scary bs in manufacturing for one of Jabil&#39;s healthcare branch sites. There was a guy that I trained when he was new and there wasn&#39;t any serious red flags because he obviously wanted to keep the job, but everything flipped on it&#39;s head after he was direct hired from being temp. He started getting super aggressive and seemed to particularly like bullying me. Shortly after his confirmation of hire this guy started screaming at me over nothing, he was dehumanizing me with many of the things he said, and then blatantly lied to our supervisor about my responses to him. This supervisor let him off on an additional break with some very sympathetic words, he was not as kind with me despite my not having done anything to this guy. <br><br>My mistake was brushing this off as a potential one time occurence since he&#39;d never behaved that poorly before, and as his trainer I thought he would return to prior behaviour. He continued with his poor behaviour more quietly with microaggressions over then next year. Then it happened again and he was even nastier about it. The trigger was me trying to help him correct an error on his paperwork before I verified it with my signature. I was able to report while being fairly mum about it, but about an hour after I had to have a private conversation with the supervisor about it because I couldn&#39;t calm down with this guy being at the station right next to mine with no alternate arrangements on that line available. The supervisor gave me an extra break and moved me to another production line that shift.<br><br>The real sticking point here is that we were a graveyard shift, so we did not have an HR team available among other support departments. It was a coworker on the shift prior to mine during the overlap period that had trained me during my temp period that convinced me to report to HR despite the delayed communications. I did end up having an interview about it with a member of HR after 2 weeks of them not being able to come in on their own office hours that start a half hour after my shift. Then it was silence for 2 months. One of the senior members of my department did end up privately informing me that our supervisor did request to fire this guy on the spot, but was denied due to company policy.<br><br>Then, when we&#39;re leaving the stand up meeting that starts every shift he hits me while storming past even though he had plenty of room to walk by. This was the last straw for me, especially since the supervisor did nothing to keep us separate despite me offering to change departments entirely. I was fortunate enough to land a job 2 days after so I had a coworker that lived near me turn in my badge and I sent an e-mail to HR informing them of my immediate resignation. This same coworker informed me that the guy in question was fired a week after I quit.<br><br>Despite all the bs at that job I really like it and had many wonderful coworkers, but it only takes bad middle management and one or two really awful coworkers to destroy an otherwise good workplace. I don&#39;t love my current job, but the problems with this workplace are actually manageable."
191,its like this in alot of places even kitchens.
192,"I&#39;m doing well at my current place and I think decently-compensated for the work I do and there&#39;s not really any redundancy for my position... yet. My company&#39;s long-term plan, and this is coming from several managers, is to get acquired by a larger company. As a result I&#39;m caught up on buying stock in the stock purchasing plan because I&#39;m an ops guy and will be extremely redundant in a larger company and can expect to be laid off almost immediately after getting acquired, so I might as well get compensated extra for it. This is in addition to the professional development work"
193,I worked in the industry myself my worst job was at Mircosoft i hated it though half of us quit at same time. Working for Indie studios is usually a better experience generally it&#39;s always people who been burnt in the industry and want to do better.
194,"That non compete seems very illegal, even in the U.S.  typically non competes only apply (if they even apply) to similar industries, and even then it can be very limited. They absolutely need to lawyer up, this is highly likely illegal under Uk law."

197,So glad I live in a country with very good labour laws and protections for employees (South Africa).
198,"I work as a QA engineer at a mid-size b2b software company (related to healthcare, so testing gets taken slightly more seriously there too maybe) -- I  think one of the biggest things that helps with the QA moral and mood is that there isn&#39;t &quot;a qa team (or a couple of them)&quot; and &quot;teams of developers&quot;, there&#39;s software engineering teams which are composed of a mix of devs and qas, each team has their own couple of QAs and their own devs, and we bond a lot more as a team. I feel included and I get a say in the design process for all of our projects right along side the developers. (*it also helps that the base payscale for both QA and Devs is the same too)<br><br>I know I could get paid more by other companies, but I&#39;ve been staying here a bit longer than I need to just because I really like my manager and I feel respected and appreciated and utilized. The atmosphere is a pretty good reason to stay - I don&#39;t know if I&#39;d want to roll the dice on the risk of getting somewhere much worse even if it came with a 10-20% raise instantly."

200,WOW. Pun intended. The evil we wade through to become the knight mare....
201,The comment on managers is SO damn true. Most people who quit a company (aside from people amicably leaving for more pay) quit the manager not the actual job.
202,"Yeah wisdom is the offspring of time, and suffering. There is no way around it."

208,"For anyone who missed the Streamer Awards, Thor did not shit his pants"
209,This story isn&#39;t far from many places in the film industry.  There&#39;s great EPs who treat you like family and then there&#39;s the savage monsters who walk in fuming about their fancy little shit taking all their frustration out on the showrunner and senior editors. It&#39;s a bad time when that happens and then it infects the whole production. Those are the gigs you walk away from as soon as possible to find another set of EPs who are passionate about what they&#39;re making.
210,My current situation is religious discrimination and HR retaliation.
211,VB is the best programming language :)

218,"I&#39;ve played Starcraft64, WoW for 12 years, and OW1 from the day they let us play it at Blizzcon until OW2 until this day, and I had no idea who &quot;Mike whatever his last name is&quot; was. Just like I have no idea who the CEO of any major game company is. If I don&#39;t know them personally then I&#39;ve probably never heard of them and honestly don&#39;t give a eff about them, no offense."

223,"2009? Rent was pretty doable in california. Housing crash, so most houses were bought at a considerably cheaper rate. Rent for me for a 3 bedroom 2 bath and a yard was 1400 in so-cal. Granted LA prices were always wild. But still it is very county and city dependent. San Diego, LA areas are fucked then and now."
224,"I love the concept of running a tactical investigation of your own company to root out the toxic pockets of corruption and mismanagement. Maybe some people with the money and power could start a team that does hardcore investigative journalism type stories on some big companies, not exclusively within gaming, but across large corporations as a whole. Unroot the rot festering within so many of these large organizations, expose it to more of the public, and put some fear of god into the back of managers‚Äô minds out there."

226,"Worked for 2 years at ATVI QA, night shift, minimal wage and 72 hours a week. At the time shit seemed fun you know playing games but that fucked up my body so hard. All the leads pretty much doing cocaine just to keep up all the time."
227,this is why you join a union
228,This chat is so great.
229,"i am unemployed for a year because i got kinda burned out being programmer, expecting to know everything, no motivation encuragement nor even training from company side. I dont know i dont ask for much . I am from germany."
230,"Ah, the good old &quot;tales from the vault&quot;, as horrifying as ever.<br>Today it&#39;s arguably worse: The &quot;QA crew&quot; is paying for the privilege of finding bugs in &quot;early access&quot;. Why hire a QA team when you can make the customers fix the game they bought?"
231,QA can be done ahead of development depending on the feature and how insanely hard you are willing to work. This is also how the entire field of predictive economics is done. Most big firms have a an extremely well paid team in them who&#39;s job it is to create models and predict with a high degree of accuracy how something will work before it has actually been implemented. Good luck getting an employee on minimum wage to do that thtough.
232,"Yes, Blizzard is bad. But to pretend this guy (Chris Sayers) isn&#39;t a problem himself is ridiculous. He/Him? Massive problem! Worked on Overwatch 2? Massive problem. Unhirable guy for anyone who wants success. He should have been fired for this level of garbage."
233,"This dude needs to lawyer up. Absolutely a wage theft situation with the promotion, and I could even see some kind of collection against the enforcement of that VERY unenforceable non compete.<br><br>There&#39;s another lesson for people just entering the labor market. Just because something is in a contract, doesn&#39;t mean it&#39;s legal, or enforceable."
234,Man I wish I had a QA in my software team.
235,You ask how is it possible for this to happen despite someone being so high up against it. The answer: Public company.
236,"Lmao, ‚Äúwe can replace you, but pls don‚Äôt join the programming team‚Äù üòÇ.  Also, I literally find bugs in games and figure out how the bug in code works without looking at code, then confirm it by repeating the bugs based on my theory of what‚Äôs happening. QA is reverse engineering. Being able to conceptualize  where potential problems are in code based on unwanted behavior is valuable."
237,Imagine complaining about people having pronouns in their username get a life moron
238,i live in the UK and no they 100% cannot stop you from working at all... probably wuth a competitior etc.. but he would 100% be able to work..
239,Activision-blizzard is a shitty company!? NO Way! are you telling me on top of being the workplace harassment and workplace sexual harassment capital of the gaming world they also don&#39;t like to pay their employees? GOSH!
240,It‚Äôs sad that QA doesn‚Äôt get the respect they deserve. I worked for a game company that made a separate company for QA just so they didn‚Äôt have to give them health benefits.
241,A badly managed company is a death wish. Employee&#39;s with a twinkle in their eyes is the heart of a company. You mistreat that then you will lose what made the company great. You cannot replace passion!

245,"the point about H1B isn&#39;t entirely correct, although for the most part yes. If your employment is terminated you have 60 days to find a new employer willing to sponsor the visa.

If the internet were bigger then , they would be megastars.  <br><br>At best ignorance is the cause of people asking for DEI in game development and the obvious is that they are POS."

All day long beating you over the head in their media telling you what to believe, what to think and what to buy. The table is tilted folks. The game is rigged, and nobody seems to notice, nobody seems to care. Good honest hard-working people -- white collar, blue collar, it doesn‚Äôt matter what color shirt you have on -- good honest hard-working people continue -- these are people of modest means -- continue to elect these rich obscenity suckers who don‚Äôt give a obscenity  about them.

264,"Its insane how companies can treat their employees like this. These things would not stand in Sweden were I live, I cant speak for all professions but as far as I know every profession has their own union who would make pretty much everyone in that workplace go on a strike untill a solution is had. Wich is something I would expect in America aswell. Swedes are generally scared of confrontation but when it comes to salary and discrimination in the workplace we put our foot down. Americans on the other hand I feel like are not as scared of confrontation wich is why it suprises me that employees dont stand togheter in something like this. Without the workers the company gets put in shambles"
265,Get that shit in writing and don&#39;t trust HR. Should be the first thing we teach folks going into the corporate world.
266,"Non compete clauses can&#39;t be enforced if that person goes and work in a different industry.

267,"My wife and I are engineers and I&#39;m transitioning into software and it boggles our minds that QA is treated as borderline uneccesary in software. Everywhere else, QA is essential!

Hell if I know if it&#39;s better anywhere else, but management is never, ever your friend."

279,thats hilariously based
280,Something that needs to be changed is the attitude toward people working in mediums like video games or other &quot;dream jobs&quot;. A job is still a job no matter what you are doing and it will take its toll on a person if they are pushed into doing things for pennies.

291,this is crazy I have been working at my new job for 2 years now and everyone there feels stuck and worthless because of how things are managed and 0 structure. everything they talked about in this is happening at my workplace right now. we are a much smaller company then blizzard and not in the same category of work but its insane how bad some workplaces can be so corruptly run. there is a new CEO in trying to clean up the company but the higher and middle management hide and cover alot of things from him. very very similar.
292,"I was expecting this story was from america, but the guy was working in Britain? Unlike the Americans, they have a labour party, what does it do? Nothing?"

If you want to be in QA go into mobile devices for apps. Way more pay and your treated like a human."

303,This whole story reminds me of something I learned the hard way.  People don&#39;t leave bad jobs.  They leave bad bosses.
304,I was QA for Atari for 6 or so years. They never allowed us to walk anywhere in the building without an escort. We were regularly laid off. To avoid paying for healthcare. We all have those stories. There&#39;s more but I don&#39;t wanna type it.

309,You sound like your shilling for amazon when most people who are on the inside usually know that every game company is connected to the elites lol follow the money.
310,Who would work there
311,To be fair from my experience with QA in software they are idiots little more capable than monkeys but that is a good thing because we need those people to break and misuse the software.
312,Why does blue hair guy feel the need to explain everything that said. Comes off is very condescending.

315,Peter principle strikes again.
316,Blizzard isn&#39;t special for years anymore. Way before MS bought them. I&#39;d argue they stopped making games long ago. All they do now is esport platforms. Nothing for people who want to play games for fun or relaxation.
317,I&#39;m building a nonprofit organization that doesn&#39;t screw over employees.
318,"I quit about a month after [redacted company] pulled the &#39;best we can do is 10% blah blah blah the economy blah blah blah corporate stuff&#39;. less than 24h after turning in my resignation I had an offer on the table, from HR with 2x pay and 2 more people to be added to my team by the end of the month.

331,To those wondering about the lawyer if it&#39;s free to bring up a case. My wife being a lawyer it depends but usually it&#39;s free. I always highly recommend talk with a lawyer for work-related suits. A lot of them will even waive any fee to just hear it
332,hr ruins game company
333,who is mike?
334,"yeah and people wonder why new releases have so much bug and issues, they fire majority of the QA team and shove the task to players"
335,"This shit sounds comically evil. If i had know all this, i would have been surprised if blizzard&#39;s leadership <b>wasn&#39;t</b> sexual predators and degenerates."
336,I am s√≥ glad to have given up on Blizzard
337,Can&#39;t believe he didn&#39;t know who Mike Morhaime is.
338,The shock these guys have when this is a company with Apartheid rules and grape culture.
339,Blizzard peaked with Warcraft 2.
340,"This is not legal advice:<br><br>If an employer tries to pin you with a non-compete you should absolutely talk to a lawyer.<br><br>Many countries have laws that make non-competes effectively unenforceable because you cannot prevent a person from working and earning a living. In a lot of situations non-competes will be unenforceable unless shown to extend no further than is reasonably necessary to protect the employer&#39;s legitimate business interests.<br><br>On a related note you can&#39;t take things with you when you leave like code, documentation, files, etc but usually the law states that there&#39;s nothing a company can do to prevent you from leaving with what&#39;s in your head. In other words you can take your knowledge and experience with you a company can&#39;t stop you from doing that. (patents and IP are a different story)<br><br><br>This is in part why larger companies, and even F1 teams for example enforce &#39;gardening leave&#39; where someone who is leaving is forced to stay until their contract expires but they basically pay them to stay home and do nothing because the risk of their knowledge going to a competitor in the short term is more important.<br><br>In Canada Non-competes are now in a legal grey area because they are straight up illegal in Ontario.<br><br>I&#39;m not a lawyer, but if you are this kind of situation you should absolutely talk to one and see what your options are."
341,how much more does AAA game companies have to fuck people over before no one buys their products?
342,"That <i>&#39;Well, you shouldn&#39;t have signed the contract then üôÇ&#39;</i> quote is terrifying from both sides.<br>Because you&#39;re effectively telling someone that they&#39;re not going to be able to make money for 3 months, who you just fired under horrible conditions, who has been worked to death for god knows how long. In case i need to spell it out for you, that&#39;s how you get someone with a &#39;propellant based force enhancer&#39; walking into the main office.<br>I have seen people, in the industry, who were in a mental place bad enough where i wouldn&#39;t have been surprised if something happened after getting sent off like that.<br><br>And living in Europe, i&#39;m 95% certain that this is in no way legal, or legally enforceable.<br>I would just ignore that, and find work anyways.<br>I&#39;d let them sue me, and lay out the months/years of financial abuse. Good luck getting a judge to sign off on barring you from working."
343,Remember that HR is not there to support and help employees. They are only there to minimize corporate blowback.
344,Cool video
345,So this guy wanted to be paid double what his UK peers were being paid for the same job?
346,blizzard is dogwater
347,"&quot;I want to work at Blizzard!&quot;<br>Blizzard: &quot;You think you do, but you don&#39;t&quot;"
348,"As a QA they don&#39;t want meticulous, they want you to finish ASAP and don&#39;t find too many mistakes. I have made the prodution side of multiple companies hate me because I&#39;m meticulous and find every Ef-up. They can complain about me but they can&#39;t get rid of me because I follow the procedures to the letter."
349,"You should only ever be paid for value to the company. Any other pay structure people should decline, it would soon stop."
350,"For the map hack, besides storing on server side, is there another solution? I assume the broker is also encrypting the units positions already?"
351,Bobby Cockdick is a pedophile
352,I love listening to 2 Java wizards
353,Dude my boss didnt do that for me but that is exactly what it was too. Mc donalds worked me like a dog for nothing. Then i got a real job and realised what normal work is. I always feel like im not doing enough. But in reality its job ptsd.
354,This video was AMAZING. This guy is just super smart... PLEASE if possible make another video with him about hacking!
355,"These kind of conversations are what terrify shitty corporations. They don&#39;t want people comparing notes because it will show how many of them are mistreating the people who enable them to garner so much wealth. Having been in the tech industry since the late 90s and through many layoffs, you learn to value good people you work with but to never be fooled by boiler plate crap they try to drill into in from your Day 1. They can call you family, Ohana, put up a nice thing about values or company culture (Wa, Makoto, Kaitakusha-seishin), in the end they will betray all of those values because they had a rough quarter and will not hold people accountable."
356,This was a cool video but I wish the guy would stop cutting Thor off to say absolutley nothing.
357,Maybe greenish hair isn&#39;t the best hair color when you are using a green screen lol
358,Pronouns on profile. Disregarded.
359,"Lifeguard with a switchblade? Tell me you worked at South Park without telling me you worked at South Park, lol!"
360,Blizzard had me until the kung fu panda expansion for WoW
361,Great vid
362,"So, yeah nothing has changed in QA since those days. It&#39;s still just as toxic as it used to be."
363,My respect for Mike Morhaime has increased exponentially from this YT video
364,I was one of the original employees of silicon &amp; synapse (since renamed blizzard) working on snes games and I can give you my opinion on how mike M would let that kind of culture get in.  Most people don&#39;t realize that Adham was the brains / driving force behind the studio.  Mike was a follower and went along with whatever Adham or B. Fargo would say.  I can&#39;t imagine Mike being the type of person who would demand things be this way or that.
365,"Fun Fact: The QA department at my work is probably considered the most important. If a mistake is found in a project, the QA Lead goes <b>hard</b> on <b>everyone</b> involved in the process - The engineer, the checker, the manager. Anyone with a hand gets in trouble if the project isn&#39;t spotless.<br><br>The dude isn&#39;t evil, though, he won&#39;t fire someone for a few mistakes, but he&#39;ll still tell people <b>to their face</b> that the work was unacceptable and they need to redo it. I&#39;m both terrified and in awe of him. Like, talk about dedication to quality!<br><br><b>That&#39;s</b> how a QA team should be treated. They <i>should</i> be the rockstars because if they aren&#39;t there to catch the mistakes, then the entire project suffers.<br><br>Edit: QA personnel <b>are</b> engineers. Anyone who says otherwise is a moron."
366,"Many people in the US, Canada and Europe that think you are living in a democracy and people have &quot;rights&quot;. But in reality you live in a bourgeoisie oligarchy, and the working laws violations are the best way to see it. The rich give orders, and ya&#39;ll just have to obey or leave"
367,"Did you know that the American Israel Public Affairs Committee (AIPAC) boasts on their website a 98% success rate for candidates that they back? They are also party agnostic, financing both Democrat and Republican candidates."
368,"5 9s is ABSURD so ambitious, best of luck"
369,"Every asterisk I had on what they said was covered before the end of the video, kudos to these incredible guys"
370,I&#39;m just gonna start drinking again. I&#39;ve literally done nothing with my life.
371,&quot;He/Him&quot;
372,"&quot;getting ahead of development&quot; to me means either have the testing expectations set before the code is done, or &quot;we are about to waste EVERYONE&#39;S time&quot;"
373,"Things start to fall apart because of an insidious mindset called Shareholder Primacy in most businesses today. As was clearly pointed out in this video, a company&#39;s priorities are its customers, its product or service and its staff. Get those things right and it really is hard to lose. Shareholder Primacy subverts these priorities. Now the focus of the company is short-term return on dividends so those in the C-Suite get their bonuses, all at the expense of cost-cutting by layoffs, plummeting staff morale and the negative effects that has on the product or service that filters down to pissed off customers.<br><br>We&#39;re in an economic realm where shareholders don&#39;t add value, they extract value and treat the businesses entity as a cash cow to aggressively milk and treat in an unsustainable, short-term-goal-oriented manner. Shareholder value is a result, not a strategy."
374,Its bonkers to me that a dev (me)  would treat a QA any different to a dev. In our team we have a QA tester embedded  and the pipeline just wouldnt function without that role
375,I learned to read and write to play diablo 1... blizzard was a part of my lfie since i was born. but eversince they went loco i stopped supporting
376,I embedded my QA team members in every dev team almost 10 years ago. It&#39;s ridiculous that people STILL have an adversarial position in these teams.
377,he asked how they get the talent back at blizzard after firing all those people. Blizzard used to be god. They havent made anything good since starcraft 2. The talent was already gone.
378,The first task on these is 1. Read all tasks. Then task 12 out of 20 is. Only do this task. Thisnis &quot;leave the room or raise your hand and say done&quot;
379,If you consider a hierarchical chart the line manager is presumably the person directly connected to their subordinate by a line. i.e. direct reports as you mentioned.
380,"You can tell from the quality of their products, that this is how they&#39;re managed. <br><br>We have a massive problem with retarded narcissists controlling all these &#39;elite&#39; institutions."
381,"The whole AAA game dev culture is odd. Game execs/managers do sketchy things...<br><br>But being a pompous QA tester? Classic. It&#39;s entry level. Historically you just blindly play a game. You are not important. Many testers I know have great skills, but the QA roles don&#39;t utilize them. They&#39;re disposable jumping off points to other places in the company."
382,"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KGQSTDm5ois&amp;t=685"">11:25</a> I‚Äôve been on the outside looking in for my whole life. My family first pc came with Diablo and Star craft. As far as pc gaming goes, I‚Äôve ALWAYS played blizzard games. But I always just thought that QA ARE devs, had no idea some of these companies don‚Äôt consider them devs. <br>As for my love of blizzard and their games, fuck ‚Äòem."
383,Why does this guy keep interrupting him? Let him tell his story. Jeez Louise. This is so freaking frustrating.. let pirate speak üôä
384,Sorry im not trusting a person with &quot;he/him&quot; in his bio.
385,"shut up and let the man talk, god damn. give the context either in the beginning, or in the end."
386,This seems like something a Programmer Union would help a lot with.
387,"elden ring is kings field 2.5 the press demo btw, nothing else. the founder always called kingsfield as the most important game for him"
388,"Both HR and for larger companys ER (Employee relations) are both for the company and not there for the people. The only real consideration that HR/Er has for the employee is risk to the business if management was to go for termination or whatever consequence management direction they are going, which is not thinking of the employee ultimately but thinking what the impact could be to the company."
389,"I&#39;m literally shook that they were paying Pirate the same as they were paying us in CS in Austin. Blizzard was supposed to be our dream job, and look what they did to our boy..."
390,no wonder the state of video games  are in the shitter
391,"In the US a non-compete is no longer legally binding if you can prove that it prevents you from pursuing your career, but I don&#39;t know how that works in the UK. Eitherway the advice in this is great for all of your looking to join corpo gang gang.<br><br>Get everything in writing, send copies to your personal email, and get a lawyer if they try to screw you."
392,"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KGQSTDm5ois&amp;t=350"">5:50</a> &quot;Yo devs, this is broken.&quot;   Uhh, yeah...  We know.  It&#39;s not done yet."
393,"How would you setup &quot;Email Mike&quot; for something like FedEx Services? God there are so many things wrong with that opco, awful stuff, and I am sure Fred doesn&#39;t know that middle management is ruining his company."
394,"There is no &quot;quick fix&quot; to the StarCraft 2 maphack problem, as the game state is entirely handled by applying each tick of inputs on each client. Sadly you can&#39;t apply inputs to units you don&#39;t know about. This was the reason for the &quot;Waiting for Player&quot; screens in War3/SC2. As soon as one client lacks behind in processing ticks, the entire session has to pause and wait for them to catch up.<br><br>This is not a problem in an ad-hoc solution like the one used in other engines, where you get the current state of each entity, and interpolate(or extrapolate) between these states."
395,You gotta interrupt the guy some more. Really ties the interview together.
396,"As a current Amazonian, who works in the AWS Data Centers, these comments have some mixed feelings for me. I love working in the Data Centers and the unique environment that&#39;s created by the people on my team. However, I cannot stand the management of this company. You are no longer a person but a number. You are replaceable, you are not special.<br><br>I have wanted to leave Amazon for a long time, but can&#39;t. I have no education, no certifications, and a pile of mental health issues that make working anywhere else difficult. A lot of the things that Chris Sayers has said, is what I&#39;ve dealt with. I have a manager that is still learning how to be a good manager and is overwhelmed. Even though I have no education, certifications, and mental health issues, it still hasn&#39;t stopped me from trying. For that, I thank you, Thor, Lord of the Chat Goblins.<br><br>Edit: Amazon/AWS is notorious for not putting things in writing. Why? No proof. Your word vs theirs."
397,I had 0 idea who mike was.
398,&quot;*P-cuz&quot;
399,"We want StarCraft 3, Warcraft 4, a GOOD diablo game. Things we&#39;ll never see from blizzard. Personally I&#39;m looking forward to Stormgate. Blizzard died after StarCraft 2 for RTS fans."
400,I finally accidentallied mybwas actoss the source of all those shorts that got me to subscribe to pirate software.
401,I&#39;ve been a Ruby on Rails developer for 10 years. <br>Why must you hurt me?
402,I want this man&#39;s headphones. Akg k712
403,I wish Blizzard never started classic WoW. I was happy to be free of them playing on private servers.
404,"&quot;QA is getting ahead of development&quot; my god, what the hell :("
405,"Holy fuck, let the guy talk man. All those interruptions are so annoying.<br><br>PS: I reported a maphacker once too in the Blizzard forums because reporting them ingame didn&#39;t do anything. But blizzard didn&#39;t ban them because there is no 100% proof that someone is hacking. Like if the enemy moves straight to your army that is moving in for an attack in fog off war to one of the many enemy bases, this is 100% proof of someone maphacking especially if it happens multiple times in the game. BUT blizzard says, well could be luck... I&#39;ve got banned from the forums for reporting another player there. Never touched anything from blizzard again. Completely incompetent"
406,Oh wow. The respect that the Internet is giving you for being a bunch of silver spoon ankle biters is laughable. The amount of people willing to be a living lava lamp is embarrassing in this day and age.
407,"My first job was as game developer. One of the seniors told me in my first 3 months &quot;testers have no name&quot;. He was joking, as he was friends with a lot of the guys, but even so, the culture was there."
408,"Am I the only one who would prefer if you just stuck to the general theme of the conversation more ? Its like... 2 lines are read from Blizzard in about 10sec, and then 5 mins or other stuff thats not that interesting, then again 2 lines about Blizzard and the point of the story, and then 5+ mins about something else mid conversation. <br><br>Just hard to actually follow and focus on the main story/subject. Half the time you keep interrupting him mid story to say something random that has nothing to do with the conversation that is happening. Not early on, but good 30-40 mins into the talk the conversation goes off the rails all the time.<br><br>If its only me noticing this and was bothered by it ? I stand corrected, keep going."
409,"Thor mentions Badge Color and the stigma behind it. I work in Intel Hardware validation and I am a contract employee. Contract employees have Green badges, Intel employees are Blue. The tech and game industry is FULL of contract work now. You want to know what classism looks like? Realize the being a &quot;CW&quot; AND having a colored badge means you are &quot;not even real employee&quot; Treatment varies from manager to manager, but it&#39;s not great. We could exabit I.T. skill BEYOND a typical desktop support tech for the state, in fact we are rated about 2-3 tech levels beyond entry level support by or contractor. It means ZERO to intel. We are BIS &quot;butts in seats&quot; Now validation technicians in our field (mostly full employees doing exactly what we do for other companies) average about 64k/yr in California. We are paid 43-47k/yr (47k is with overtime) which is the bottom 10-15% of our curve. Jumping back to those state workers? Entry level I.T. with the state is making $25/hr equivalent OR higher. Essentially? We are paid LESS and have LESS benefits than a tech 2 levels below our skill grade. &quot;Well contract work is supposed to be temporary&quot; Well yea... they tell you that. I know a guy who worked here 15 years as a CW, got hired as a Blue badge, and during the BIG tech recession (The industry Binge and Purge cycle) he was let go after maybe 1-2years. He made it... then was let go. Just crushing."
410,Why does this guy have to stop and clarify literally every other sentence
411,"I worked at activision/blizzard as a QA for 2 years before the Microsoft switch and law suits. It doesn‚Äôt matter how hard you work or how good the work you do is, the high school mentality and cliques is the whole system all the way up to management. Terribly run and leaves individuals feeling so empty and used."
412,Such an awesome colab.
413,"Hearing Thor talk about the boss who said that his staff are all replaceable, I experienced the exact same thing. At a team building lunch, I don&#39;t know what triggered our boss to say it but we were all loudly talking to each other and having fun when he suddenly loudly and angrily announced &quot;You know you are all replaceable.&quot; When we all just stopped talking and looked awkwardly at each other he smugly nodded to himself as if that&#39;s exactly what he wanted. Everyone&#39;s motivation died at that exact moment. I refer to it as the team building lunch that turned into a team ending lunch."
414,"As a developer, you have to treat the QAs well, and it pays back when you do. I had a few times where I was a little ticked that I screwed up, and messaged the quality worker that I was mad at myself. You are a fighter pilot, but the QA is responsible for your jet doesn&#39;t blow up in the sky."
415,Congrats to her for being the last black female major they&#39;ll ever elect
416,Thanks for this. I will no longer support Blizzard with my wallet.
417,"&quot;Keep the work, Change the job.&quot; Damn I really needed to hear that."
418,"Most EVE Online developers were/are players. The company actually has set of rules for how developers handle their accounts and what they are allowed and not allowed to do (since the game has politics and economy stuff, they can&#39;t abuse that knowledge to do better in the game, at least not at a level that shifts the tides)."
419,@min 44 - <br>Upper management should collaborate with lower management to allow a secret internal investigation to see how deep the rabbit hole goes.
420,"If I could sum this up on a higher level - there is very often this rivalry between QA and devs, or dev and product, and this happens when people are stuck in their corner not caring about the big picture. Your product is going to suck if you don&#39;t understand the entire process of creating it, and the entire process of how people are using it. If you DO understand the process, you would inevitably gain great respect for people doing things you are not doing in your job and perhaps you are not even born with the personality needed for some of these jobs. If I could even push this a bit further - if you really care, you would want to be able to do everything related to your product at least to some extent so you could understand it better. Then, decisions that you take would solve problems holistically and the more you understand, these solutions would be more natural, easier to support and would last longer.<br><br>So the only reason you would create this divide between people would be that you don&#39;t yet understand a lot of important things and sooner or later this is going to come back around at you and would cost you a lot."
421,"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KGQSTDm5ois&amp;t=1720"">28:40</a> I can confirm, I have no idea who that fag Mike something was"
422,The saying you dont quit a jobb you quit bosses.
423,Elden ring isn&#39;t created by &#39;a guy&#39;
424,Watched this video accidentally and I&#39;m happy.<br>Loved overwatch 1 but damn ... No can&#39;t ever go back to it.
425,"I would find it very hard to believe Blizzard internally was always this bad.  Recently after Activision took over, Yes I believe shit fell apart, but I still firmly believe before then that Blizzard was an actual company that actually cared about its employees, its fans, and its games."
426,"guy crying about his wages but he stayed 4 years.  Either he is entitled, or he is just trying to use emotional content to draw in viewers.<br>you dont work some place 4 years if you didnt like it.   <br>You can easily go else where after a year ESPECIALLY if you already have Blizzard already on your resume / CV"
427,I was payed as much as for an associate QA during my internship as a dev. And a senior QA(thats like at least 3years of experience btw) was payed the same as an associate dev(1-2 years of experience).
428,This was super fun to watch. It&#39;s crazy that he lives in Bozeman. I ran into him in public and was so confused. I used to live in Helena. Miss that place. Glad I stumbled upon you! Can&#39;t wait for more content.
429,"lol not sure how QA gets ahead of the  dev team unless it refers to proactive test planning<br>based on design documents or developing automated tests"
430,I&#39;m always curious who was the primary motivator behind these kinds of practices at Blizzard. You have a company doing what people see as &quot;magic&quot; and you then decide &quot;You know what we need to do? Treat our employees like absolute garbage...&quot; Makes no good sense. I imagine Mike must have been livid to see his beloved company fall to crap around him because of these people.  In this case it sounds very generally that middle management hiring and vetting practices simply were not sufficient. I find studying the people who decide these kinds of things morbidly fascinating. It is usually a small core or one very influential person who tends to drive these kinds of practices.
431,if you&#39;re gonna have a guest on your channel can ya let em finish a sentence once in awhile?1
432,"Blizzard seems to a place that&#39;s amazing to have on your resume, terrible to actually work for"
433,"in SOCAL for anyone that doesn&#39;t know, you need a minimum wage of like 20 dollars an hour to be able to own even a small apartment that will be an hour and a half away from wherever you work. You&#39;ll have to get a place in glendale or one of the surrounding cities, and you&#39;re gunna fucking love it foor like 6 months until you realize living in LA fucking SUCKS for so many reasons and the only reason people DO still move there are going for a dream they probably will never even get a taste of. Fuck LA."
434,"im so glad I ditched my college major in the game industry shit and just moved over to lib arts lol. I was one of those kids that was going to do what I could to work at blizzard, and I&#39;m glad I became a leftist early enough in life to realize how fucked that path was going to be in a few years. EA was the big red flag that killed my interest in going down that career path. I feel bad for all the people that didnt get out and just kept going in that field because they&#39;re afraid to just quit and try something else."
435,I feel that pay difference from moving to a night staff member to a day staff to my core.  No one told me i would lose that and the amount of responsibility that came with the day shift over the night shift was astounding.  Mind you its the same job and position.  they are payed a dollar more for Awake Overnight (AON) when half of them sleep at the desk.... its absurd.
436,"Engineers are the rockstars...in every industry.   Doesn&#39;t make it right people were treated like shit to make the product work, but that is the reality."
437,California dreaming.  Yeah ok.  Who ran blizzard?  Who is your governor?  There&#39;s your answer.
438,I have an inability to feel sorry for someone who has their pronouns in their bio
439,If they have pronouns anywhere on their profile they CANNOT be takin seriously.
440,Now if only Amazon DSPs had the same workplace &quot;feel&quot; as AGS. Talk about overworked and overlooked.
441,"Hearing management say &quot;you are all essential, we appreciate every one of you and the work you do makes this all possible&quot; but still recieve subpar pay isnt really any better than being spoken to poorly and getting the same subpar pay. Gaslighting employees who are actually required to enable the company to make any money, to make them start to believe it is good that the company is allowing them to stay is just additional unneeded toxicity."
442,Pronoun degenerates üòÇ what a toolbag. Emps need to go off already
443,Could you stop interrupting your guest? I‚Äôm not even 3 minutes in and you‚Äôve continuously interrupted him because you are assuming your audience is primarily 7 year olds.<br>‚ÄúDURR ACKTHUALLY A HALF WAY HOUSE IS LIEK A THING WHERE‚Äù yeah I‚Äôm not finishing this video
444,"I worked for EA, luckily I heard a voice in my head say, ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a trap!‚Äù And 2 weeks later I found another job. There was more to the story, but that‚Äôs the short version.üòä"
445,"workers rights vs us economy... <br>ooops, no workers rights in the us, I forgot."
446,its 1100 to 1500 dollars to rent a room here in michigan too.
447,"&quot;he/him&quot; this is the lamest path in the future. humans have to be circular, pushing back against color, segregation and judging people with  labels to now blaming colors, separating places and people and only identifying with your label is just crazy."
448,All glory to the working class
449,"Thor is AWESOME. I love his stories and info. I am 34 (35 this year) and just getting into the tech world (finishing up my college course).<br><br>This will help. I am to fuckin&#39; old to deal with shit and drama, and his advise can help me navigate it"
450,"We were working with blizzard way prior to 2006. From Diablo, starcaft and warcraft. Guess early 2000&#39;s and mid to late 1990&#39;s didn&#39;t count. Blizzard was a mess even before you were at blizzard."
451,"I&#39;m really bewildered. I work as narrative\game designer for 15 years now. In Russia. I have never experienced any such things. I worked for big companies, small companies, micro teams, corpo cold machines and lax amateurs. i was never insulted, cruelly lied to like in these examples, I almost never worked extra. Most of the time I work very relaxed. My biggest problems were inexperienced ppl in charge, ppl with opinions I don&#39;t agrree with etc. My salary is higher than average and I couldn&#39;t call it insulting. I was never swindled, always get the money we talked about even when all the terms were under the table, no paperwork, etc. I worked with women and never saw them mistreated, harassed etc. Of course its anecdotal. It doesn&#39;t mean all these things don&#39;t happen in the industry, but still, I worked at dozens of companies and never saw it. <br>My career was far from perfect, i have my regrets and frustrations.

461,"I&#39;ve worked in QA for about 23 years - for a company that does QA for other software &amp; hardware companies.  Primarily device driver testing and application testing, very little game testing.  As such, I have seen an amazing variety of ways companies (and individuals) react with QA, although I don&#39;t really have any horror stories like the ones out of Blizz in this video.  Being good at QA takes a particular mindset - not only being very detail-oriented, so that you notice things that are wrong, but the ability to keep being that focused when you&#39;ve been through the same little app, or website, or map in a game, over and over  (imagine being a person testing MS Word for years on end, and you <b>still</b> have to be capable of catching the bugs, not just cruising through test scripts).  It&#39;s not just being a failed or wannabe developer (although there are a lot of both in QA).<br><br>The big companies I&#39;ve worked with tend to treat QA poorly - they know we&#39;re needed to catch all the mistakes of the devs so that a good product goes out the door, but we don&#39;t actually <b>create</b> any content.  Even the discovered bug counts tend to be treated as reflective of dev issues (or lack of) rather than indicative of how thorough QA is being.  And I had to laugh at PirateSoftware&#39;s story about the dev noticing the color of his badge and cutting him off - I had that exact experience (and generally being ignored, which was actually useful sometimes) because my badge color marked me out as a contractor, not even a &quot;real&quot; employee.<br><br>More and more we find ourselves working with smaller companies, where QA teams - even outsourced - are recognized as contributing and having a unique skill set in the development process.<br><br>Ultimately, though, my experience has been that there&#39;s two types of devs - those who see QA as someone telling them that their baby is ugly, and those who see QA as someone helping them create a better product."

463,"&quot;The passion leaves, you still got the name, but you don&#39;t got the game&quot; - you&#39;re seeing this with Dawn of War 3, Company of Heroes 3, and Homeworld 3. Hell 8 months ago they fired Quinn Duffy for Homeworld 3 and than finally did a beta and all the people testing it were like &quot;what is this crap?&quot;. They delayed the game - but they DON&#39;T HAVE THE TALENT TO FIX IT!"
464,"Oh yeah another story of Blizzard bullshit. So they would have mandatory meetings at the Irvine Spectrum at something like 7 or 10 in the fucking morning (just remember it was DIRECTLY AFTER OUR SHIFT) where they would reward their &quot;stellar employees&quot; with points they could buy shit out of a catalogue. Now the floor managers also had an amount of points they could give out to regular workers so they too could possibly get some incentives. <br><br>In a meeting I asked our manager how many points they were allowed to give out a month. It was roughly 100. I asked him how many employees were under him. It was over 100.<br><br>Each month every employee could not possibly gain a single point each. You would never be able to get even a shitty acid-etched cup.<br><br>There&#39;s also bullshit QA stories when it came to them doing QA on customer service. You would have macros to talk to players. You would have 2 conversations, that were 100%, the exact same conversation. One week they would score it a 85. The next week a 70. The week after that an 80. The next week a 65. The week after an 85. <br><br>There was zero fucking consistency."
465,"I was a former blizz staff too and they treated us like shit. Night crew GM would be on &quot;mandatory overtime&quot; daily, every day, for literal months. But the day crew? By the time they came on, we would have bottomed out the Q. So they go home on time every day, and let the Q stack. Than we come on and they announce overtime.<br><br>I would be curious to hear your thoughts on Chris Metzen and his contribution (or lack there of in my opinion) to formulating and advancing the story side of Warcraft."

As soon as jews and other ethnicities arrived at Auschwitz, from days long cattle car train rides, the SS officers would select woman, men, children and the elderly into 2 groups. Men, women and children over 12 to the right (those able of physical labor ) and the rest to the left. The left side went straight to the gas chambers, no questions asked. Often with orchestral music in the background to keep people calm and docile."
468,"the whole fake promition isn&#39;t isolated to blizzard. I work at a canadian retail store that contains what you call someone from canada in the first word followed by a round rubber vehicle part. My friend was promised the manager position for the store, which is a salery position. Then began working it, being told things like &quot;the promotion is coming, but we dont do promotions until november&quot; november came &quot;oh cause you are a lead postion you have to do a year of supervisor&quot; during this year the store hired people to try being that manager (A. imagine having to train the person for the job you have been promised, B. that new person left with in 4 months) now another year later they finally promoted them. So even thou they were doing the job they were promising it took 2 years to actually be given after it seems all other routes to screw them out of the position."

472,"I had a similar situation where I got a &quot;promotion&quot; and they kept putting off my raise. I started at this company where I made bookstore websites for colleges, and I had a computer science degree. The pay was shit, but I felt the experience would pay off (and eventually it did). After a year there they wanted me to go work on some of their back end systems in the ancient language of RPG IV and CL. They also wanted me to use this coding generator software called Genexus for some reason, even though I knew the language that generator would convert to. Basically I was promised this huge raise so I did what that guy did and believed them. I took this position and every month I asked my boss &quot;when can I get that raise&quot; and they were always like oh yea its coming, dont worry. Around 8 months go by, still nothing. <br><br>One day this college student that sat behind me that I helped ALL THE TIME mentioned how much he was getting paid. It was twice as much as me. I was like wtf, how are they paying you this much? He said his step dad was in charge of our department, and I said that sounds like nepotism and he just replied &quot;yea basically&quot;. I got a new job like two weeks later. My boss had the audacity to be like &quot;dude wtf we were just about to give you that raise&quot;. I just remember not saying anything, but staring at him like &quot;we both know thats bull shit&quot; and he was like &quot;well it was going to be a few more months&quot; and I was just like yea, nah I&#39;m done. <br><br>There was so much other stuff going on there that made me incredibly uncomfortable. I was in this office with a glass door. My boss and their click faced the door so they could basically have locker room talk about the girls passing by. These guys were all married and like 50 + years old talking about shit they wanted to do to 18~21 year olds every single day. It was so incredibly uncomfortable and unprofessional. I had never seen sexual harassment before at a work place, but seeing that shit on a daily basis was absolutely insane. This one girl specifically they waited for her to walk by all the time to talk about what she was wearing and shit. I just feel so bad for people who get into jobs like that and think this is how every company is and they just deal with it."
473,"Never worked in the industry, but damn was this conversation fascinating, and dumbed down so my 3 braincells could understand."

You are replaceable at any time, so don&#39;t fuck up and end up back in here because I assure you, you will not be happy to see me&quot;. He was also having an affair with my direct supervisor, whom either he or his friend got pregnant while on a Vegas trip (threesome).

489,"I&#39;m in my 35th year as a dev and the respect I&#39;ve built up for the test/QA guys who keep saving my butt is immense.  I lack the discipline required to plan and execute comprehensive test coverage, I just couldn&#39;t do it. I remember being in a meeting a few years ago where our tester Kiran was sitting in so she could stay abreast of any changes we made to the design.  I&#39;ll never ever forget it.  She very respectfully pointed out a huge hole in our stupid design and 2-3 devs, a solutions architect and the PM all slapped our foreheads, you could almost hear &quot;d&#39;oh!&quot; üòÖ We were grateful obviously but it sounds like the guy who cut off conversation after seeing you didn&#39;t have a dev ID would have been angry? Wtf.  Kiran was an awesome test lead, you probably guessed that already.. man I detest arrogance ü§¨"
490,"Yes doing what you love, will carry you through more than them throwing money at you"
491,&quot;QA testing ahead of development&quot; is like taking a car for a test drive before it&#39;s even assembled. It takes a special level of idiot to think that&#39;s possible.
492,"Too bad I&#39;ve seen Pirate&#39;s content before all this, and now I can&#39;t trust him."
493,Yeah unfortunately this is the foundation of corporate America not even just the gaming industry. It&#39;s retarded and frustrating the amount they can get away with. Here&#39;s an example. I work 50+ hour work weeks and because of my position it&#39;s deemed acceptable for me to have to drive a half hour to need to go to the bathroom. However if I&#39;m 10 minutes back past my clock out time it&#39;s an issue.
494,"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KGQSTDm5ois&amp;t=2654"">44:14</a> I think companies need to be careful when going that route in hiring an outside help when it comes to HR.  I think it was Vanguard who promoted the DEI (Diversity Equity and Inclusion) program onto the companies that brought them in to improve working conditions.  When you bring in people who think external appearances (race/gender/sexual orientation) is a better substitute for marital talent and experience your company will find itself in a financial hell it may never recover from.    Don&#39;t believe look at Budweiser."
495,"I&#39;m at the very start of the story and I&#39;m already getting annoyed. <br>So he was doing a less physically demanding task and got paid less. And somehow we&#39;re all supposed to view this as a negative. This is entitlement. I&#39;m sorry, but whatever else discussion brings past this point, whatever negative treatment or unfair pay they got. This needs to be said. You don&#39;t deserve to be paid more than your labor is worth. <br>Secondly, everyone always brings up inflation when they wanna justify Sony charging $700 for their latest boiled over turd, nobody brings up inflation when we&#39;re talking about past wages of laid off people. Guys talking 2009, $10.50 in 2009 is equivalent to $15 right now, only six states have minimum wage at or above $15, and most states have minimum wage half of that right now. And as far as CPI is concerned, $10.50 in 2009 had the same buying power as $30 does today, so their &quot;low wage&quot; for doing software testing in a well lit air conditioned environment bereft of any meaningful manual labor afforded them a wage double that of what a vast majority starts with today while having to deal with all the excess crap mentioned all so that their money today has half the worth of what the QA&#39;s did then. <br>And as far as living prices in California, that&#39;s a red herring fallacy. Wages are a matter of workforce competence, labor demand, and difficulty and responsibility imposed by that work. They&#39;re not a matter of your life choices and decisions that led you to that particular form of work. At what point does society stop bearing responsibility for your poor life decisions? You wanted a lifestyle, you assume the cost that comes with it, it is nobody&#39;s responsibility to cover for your poor choices.<br>And every discussion is all about this, the appeal to emotion &quot;Well they&#39;re people&quot; so what? Like genuinely, so what? Everyone defending this and talking crap about management, and spouting that feelgood &quot;everyone deserves nobody should ever be&quot; bs has guaranteed at one point or another said someone should be fired. But as soon as it comes to the videogame industry we&#39;re all of a sudden supposed to act like people in gamedev are infallible. You&#39;re only hearing one side of the story and deciding it is 100% true. For all you know this person could have been coming in to work drunk every day, for all you know they could have a child tied up in their basement right now. You don&#39;t know, but poor them, they should be treated better because they told me a one-sided narrative specifically engineered to make them seem like the victim in their own story that they&#39;ve written knowing nobody will rebuttal or elaborate any of it. Like the guy said &quot;imagine getting fired for being meticulous&quot; HOW DO YOU KNOW?! By which criteria did you determine they specifically took the longest because they were being &quot;meticulous&quot;? Why? Why is that the one singular possible outcome of this scenario? Is it impossible they didn&#39;t know what they were doing? is it impossible they were trying to ride out the clock? Is it impossible they were half asleep because they don&#39;t know how to manage their work/life balance? Give me a break man. <br>At this point, if you&#39;re just pro dev no questions asked, you&#39;ve either never held a job or genuinely don&#39;t know what it&#39;s like to live in the real world. I swear to god, skepticism is dead and it&#39;s been killed by videogame fanboys. <br>And before anyone says they had no choice. In 2009, you could buy an entire house in Ohio for about $40k. There&#39;s always a choice, people just don&#39;t want to take it. But as I stated before, you not wanting to do something isn&#39;t the responsibility of society. There are Places where you could buy a house and feed yourself for a year on the amount of money you spend on rent in some California cities in 6 months. And you don&#39;t want to move and look for a new job? That&#39;s absolutely reasonable and there is nothing wrong with that. But that is YOUR choice, and it is not the responsibility of society to compensate for that. Just because you don&#39;t acknowledge the concept of personal responsibility doesn&#39;t mean it stops existing."

Unfortunately, the managers that were hiding this stuff were also learning and kept the bad from him.<br><br>In regards to CS, we went through a huge change back in 2009/2010.

527,The argument for Q/A getting ahead of development is called test driven development.<br>It involves writing unit tests to the specifications of the product before the code is developed.  It doesn&#39;t make sense with manual tests but it could work with coded unit tests.  It kind of falls apart though because of how fast specifications change.

538,"Customer Support at Blizzard was treated just as badly as QA was. I quit the company back in 2009 after 3 years simply because I couldn&#39;t stand working there anymore. I hated it. After taking 3 weeks off for vacation time I returned to the office and within 15 minutes I basically was ready to go home again because I just couldn&#39;t stand it. To give you one example of what caused problems. Initially when I started as a GM tickets were assessed internally at random by people higher up the food chain. It was assessed based on professional behavior and accuracy of policy. I did very well with that. Then they changed the system to go 100% based on &quot;customer satisfaction&quot; (meaning the customer rates the GM interaction from a ticket) and guess what...<br><br>...Whenever you say no to a player because policy says so you&#39;re getting a bad rating. This affected me personally because I don&#39;t like manipulating people. A no is a no and so I got bad rating. They send me to a training to &quot;improve customer interaction&quot; in which they showed only standard cases basically consisting off:<br>Player: &quot;I want something restored&quot;<br>GM: &quot;I can&#39;t because.....reason&quot;<br>Player: &quot;But I want it!&quot;<br>GM: &quot;Sorry, but I can&#39;t give it to you&quot;<br>player: &quot;Okay then, have a nice day&quot;<br><br>This is not how &quot;difficult&quot; customers work though. So I opened my mouth and asked question &quot;but what if the customer doesn&#39;t react this way?&quot; because if it&#39;s a training I want to take something useful from it. I got no answer. What I got instead was being reported to my senior (team lead) for &quot;sabotaging the training&quot; and instead of talking it through with me in a normal way I was immediately viewed as guilty.<br><br>Also as a GM you&#39;re supposed to get high customer satisfaction rating while always having the clock behind you though because you had to do 12 tickets an hour meaning you had 5 minutes on average to talk with the customer, analyze and solve their issue while being friendly. Oh and if you had a case you had to escalate (&quot;hacked&quot; accounts for example) then you still had to do chat and work but didn&#39;t get ticket counted for you because it would be assigned to someone higher up.<br><br>A couple of weeks/months later my team lead came back to me and pushed me for various reasons to either change my &quot;attitude&quot; or consider quitting. Shortly after he received my decision via letter of resignation that I put on his table. Btw. one of their complaints was that I never volunteered for extra work days (they weren&#39;t allowed to force people to do extra days). I told my senior if they had offered that I can take days off when there is little work I would&#39;ve offered to do an extra day once in a while but they only offered money and I didn&#39;t consider that enough motivation to come in for an extra day especially because it would&#39;ve been taxed considerably higher. So yeah, doing your 40hour week with little to no sick leave and acting professionally according to policies apparently was &quot;insufficient&quot; in their eyes..."

The first meeting effectively involves the lawyer figuring out whether they think there&#39;s a matter they can take you on for, followed by a conflict check (because they also can&#39;t charge you if they already have a client that would be in conflict with you, in this situation if they worked with Blizzard)."

554,"I worked in the aerospace industry for a bit (just a tad under 5 years) and the thing is, that separation of departments started happening where I worked too. When we were an expanding company, fabricators (like me) were encouraged to talk to the engineers and machinists to discuss how things could work better. A person who makes the parts is also generally part of QA in that industry, because if you screw up, you need to know how not to do it again. The process is simple on the surface, but complicated the more you work with the materials and parts.<br><br>At the end there, we were strongly discouraged from talking to the engineers, and the most hilarious thing to me was when simple parts that they would request would have obviously been easy to make in a certain way had they just talked to the people making the parts who were knowledgeable about how they could be made. And the same kinda language was used, like they were afraid that people would switch sides somehow if they were exposed to the grunts making the parts or, visa versa, the grunts were exposed to the ivory tower engineers. It created a pretty toxic work environment."

But now I have been given so much random bullshit that isn&#39;t even part of IT work that I actually do my IT work at night. Because over the day there is almost no time do my stuff. I had a meeting with my boss, the head of the facility about it, that I don&#39;t enjoy it anymore and that change needs to happen because they hired me to do their IT work and not some random office work bullshit. I got told that work isn&#39;t going to change that we all have to go through this hard time. Disapointed I left and the thought of quitting manifested. literally the next day I got 6 more projects of the kind of office bullshit I told him I hate from my manager. I felt personally attacked and quitting was no longer a thought. I put myself out there and I&#39;m currently having interviews with multiple companies to change my job. when everything is in writing I&#39;m gone.

585,As a career switching software engineer currently getting shit on and underpaid at a startup. This really helped me out. These stories were incredibly cathartic
586,"The thing I was fooled into was that as new in the role, and considering I could not be expected to be able to work fully well from start in that role while I learn it, I could not get as big of increase in salary as I would otherwise get. This of course implies that when I DO get into the role, I should get the salary adjusted by then at least. But later it was of course no one telling me that the time had come, and after even changing boss (the previous one going back to his old role as my college, but now called &quot;senior&quot;) then I had to tell my new boss about this arrangement and only then after complaining I get another increase. But it was REALLY modest, not at all what is should be. But he himself felt so proud I noticed. But I made sure to tell him it was not still what I expected. Later on now, I notice how titles around me changes, so even though the area I work in was considered advanced it is now just seemingly like any other controller job (well expect the for former boss with frozen boss salary that will be the only senior even though I have worked many many years in this role my now as well). The bottom line is, companies do not know how to value workers that are actually valuable for the company. Most people would not know actually what you contribute to (or not). It doesn&#39;t surprise me at all that complete incompetent people can be promoted, while others are not. And also like was mentioned, you often cannot advanced in the role you currently have as well, even though you are dam good at it and can do it better then others."

He got a detail wrong though, it wasn&#39;t a sheet of paper, it was an e-mail. The reason I know this for sure is that when this happened I was not at my normal work station because I was told to do patch testing for mac, which meant I was logged into a computer in a separate area of the QA floor and didn&#39;t have any of my normal apps, including email, pulled up. So while I&#39;m doing patch testing I see people start filing out and when ~half the people are gone I ask a supervisor what is going on and they responded cryptically, &quot;They are following instructions.&quot; So I shrug and continue doing my job patch testing on a mac which is what I had been instructed to do ~20 minutes prior. <br><br>A few minutes later a different supervisor comes up to me and tells me I failed the task. When I explained that I wasn&#39;t at my workstation they said that isn&#39;t their problem and that I should be watching my e-mail at all times. I was wise enough to know I was speaking to someone power-tripping and let it drop.<br><br>In the end I was not fired. I was kept on Night Shift. The team was not dissolved entirely as Thor said, it was reduced to 10 people of which I was one. I still work in the games industry making many times the money I made back in Blizz QA but I will remember this story forever as the most cringeworthy &#39;test&#39; of my entire career."
596,"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KGQSTDm5ois&amp;t=930"">15:30</a> Is there factual basis to believe that FromSoft is fundamentally different? Is there a good reason to believe they focused on making a good game first and profit second? I&#39;m asking because you didn&#39;t give any reason for these beliefs. And having these kind of unfounded beliefs is why people end up in bad positions in the gaming industry. They buy into the hype, into the appeal. Consider if you&#39;re not committing the kind of fallacy that helped grow Blizzard&#39;s unwarranted good reputation and that contributed to employees getting exploited because working for Blizzard is so prestigious?<br><br>Don&#39;t get me wrong, FromSoft did not miss a beat with its souls series yet. I don&#39;t have reason to believe they mistreat employees (other than the fact that this is very common in the industry). But you can&#39;t just can&#39;t make claims like that about FromSoft without backing just because like their product. There are other companies that were praised for appearing to care about their games a lot while they were exploiting their workers and definitely putting profit first.<br><br>And again, you might be entirely right that FromSoft is genuinely good! I don&#39;t know! But this is more about the pattern of engaging and making statements that I&#39;m worried about.<br><br>Also, the whole idea that &quot;good game, good profit&quot; is an oversimplification. And it&#39;s fine to simplify things, but in this case it&#39;s potentially harmful. Starfield probably made a profit. There are a lot of good games out there that had moderate financial success, and some good games that outright flopped. Good game is not sufficient for profit, and also not necessary (though if you make a shit game you better have brand goodwill, like in the case of Starfield). I worry about indies, small and medium studios believing &quot;good game, good profit&quot; too strongly, because there are so many ways to make a good game and fuck up at actually getting money out of it."
597,"Michael, how yea doing man!  Did not expect to come across you from following Thors content!  So cool!  On topic with QA.... Indeed laid off all of their physical QA last year, and now all of the devs literally are also the QA.  My team was lucky enough to keep ours, but he has had to spend the last 6 months learning to be a SWE.  I will never sit on the side of the field that thinks QA is not needed.

606,"As to the layoffs, I think you guys hit all around Microsoft&#39;s intentions without realizing it. Hear me out, here. <br><br>Microsoft is well known for it&#39;s stance against  ANYONE making money off their products other than themselves. They don&#39;t allow it.<br><br>Blizzard is notorious at this point for allowing 2nd and 3rd parties to profit from their products, especially WoW.<br><br>Microsoft KNOWS the same things we, as players, know. They know there&#39;s an insane number of people who would return to a more classic-feeling experience without all the hyper inflation and gatekeeping players. The anti-gdkp/bot/gold-seller routines that are being placed into SoD now are proof they are not hip with the way Blizz let things go south since basically the start of Cata. Everything about classes in retail is bloated and makes new players not want to stay. No efforts are made to stop players and small farming companies from destroying the economy. The leveling process has been shortened to an afternoon to force you into current content with no knowledge of how your class actually works. All in all, retail is horse shit.<br><br>Microsoft, by laying off all those people who literally coded the last ten years of Blizzard min/maxing profits instead of fun, is setting up a new era of how things work. I have literally ZERO idea where they&#39;ll land in the end, but it makes complete sense to get rid of the people who created the nightmare that the game has become. They want outside profiteering gone from their product, and as long as they don&#39;t go the Ubisoft/EA/etc route of pay to win bullshit, they have my full support.<br><br>Am I in any way happy about how those people were treated? No, of course not. I&#39;m also not happy about how Blizzard turned one of the most amazing games ever created into a shitshow of circus freaks who are more concerned with efficiency and speed than socializing and having fun. You guys hit all around this, so it&#39;s kinda weird you didn&#39;t bring it up yourselves. I&#39;m sorry your friends got reamed by Microsoft, but those same people created the horrible disappointment that is current retail. Makes total sense to start over."

628,"4 years later .... in QA - thats the problem.    I started in QA doing game testing,  QA at faang,  sdet,  and dev.    Being totally honest,   QA died when boxed products died.    Modern software development requires fast turn arounds.   When i started we had 6 month releases,  then 3 months,  then 1 month then weekly.    You cant release weekly with QA.   QA was crutch for developers to not write unit tests and test up front.   Someone else doing your build manually means you dont need to invest in automated builds which means you lose the infrastructure to deploy a hotfix in a day - when hours is too long.     You absolutely can replace QA - I would argue that you actually must replace QA in order to invest in faster releases.   So you get rid of QA but even automation QA ( SDETS ) is not fast enough.   End to end tests that take several hours... too long.   You have to get rid of SDETs.    Yes you lose something there is a cost to it,   games ship buggier,   devs get stretched thinner.  But there is a benefit for experiencing the pain of releases.    Devs on call,  devs will prioritize on call.   Devs doing support will prioritize support.  It removes the &quot;someone elses problem&quot; problem.   Bringing content creators closer to the product.    Everyone who fondly remembers the magic of working boxed software lives in a different era - users require consistent content these days.  Competition requires faster releases.   None of this is possible with outdated QA methodologies.   QA doesnt scale,  end to end tests written by different teams dont scale.    Another team filing bugs to be triaged doesnt scale.   Modern development is about releasing fast and failing fast and having the infrastructure to do so.   Games live and die on their ability to update constantly.   Even non live services.   Only nintendo can get away with the old boxed product style releases these days."

If you&#39;re going to spread lies about me because I refused to drive a van while I was actually nearly passing out and feeling sick and later determined by a doctor that I had an infection that was turning sceptic, and you then want to take me into a meeting and tell me lies about people complaining about me? Nah, I called sick the next day (which was my friday), I got another job that started immediately, and when I went in to work on Monday I handed in my uniform and resignation letter, and walked out. Zero notice. <br><br>FYI, I only learned for sure their lies were untrue when I apologized to a former coworker a year later after quitting alcohol, in fact I was regularly called the best they ever worked with.

641,"I was working at a local restaurant a couple years ago. Not gonna name any names, I still think the owner&#39;s a great chef and a great guy... just a horrible manager.<br><br>Place had been open for maybe 6 months when I walked in for an interview? Japanese restaurant (so, sushi made in front of house. meals and all that made in back of house. Not just some sushi place with fried rice and 5 different variations of soup). I go in for a front of house job, they&#39;ve got positions open for it and at the time it&#39;s what I&#39;d done for a bit and what tends to pay better if the restaurant is good enough to attract a lot of regulars.<br><br>Sit down with the owner, got some sodas on the table and my resume, he looks at me and just says &quot;yeah, you&#39;re gonna cook&quot;.<br><br>Told him straight up that aside from some sandwich places with flat-top grills and what I&#39;d do for myself at home I didn&#39;t have any experience in restaurant, he said he&#39;d teach me. So I said yes.<br><br>At first, it was me and one other cook and a dishwasher in the kitchen. Other cook wasn&#39;t really that great, she&#39;d been there for a while and was probably getting burnt out from being alone in there to handle a fryer, grill, stove top, prep table, and about 4-6 dozen tickets on a regular night... plus supporting the sushi bar with fried rolls or fresh tempura flakes and whatever else they needed asap. Dishwasher was a drunk and got fired a month later for coming in shitfaced and belligerent. So about a month in it&#39;s just me and her now manning all those things plus the dish pit (which really is more important to a kitchen than you&#39;d think. Having dishes being handled for you so you can just keep up the pace without suddenly needing a pan and not having it is HUGE. Dishwashers really need better pay).<br><br>Another month in after losing the dishwasher, other cook gets fired. Not for no reason, she was definitely in a slump. Lotta food started going out undercooked or otherwise wrong and at this point I was basically just doing frying and prep and plating. I saw it coming, she needed out and the restaurant honestly needed her out. The problem was that she got fired without even another 2nd cook or a dishwasher. Oh fucking boy, I&#39;m flying solo in a job that I have 2 months of experience in total and should be done by 3 different people at least.<br><br>I should probably also add, I don&#39;t just mean I was the only cook in there at night. I was the only cook IN THERE. So, five 12+ hour shifts plus a half-day every week and any other time the place was just not open. Two more things to add. 1: the restaurant was still pretty young at this point and the owner did NOT skimp on ingredient quality, so it was not profitable yet and the owner wasn&#39;t mentally prepared to have to keep pushing to get it in the green (though it&#39;s still running so I&#39;m guessing he&#39;s gotten his act together on that front). 2: I made either the worst mistake or the best decision early depending on how you think about it. My first month&#39;s paycheck was something like 4 grand (paid hourly at minimum wage with tip share). At this point in my life, that was double nearly any other job I had outside of one really nice restaurant I was a server in. I knew the owner was struggling with the restaurant losing money, and again... he was a really cool guy and honestly did what he could to keep everyone (customers and employees) happy. So I offered him to salary me at like 3 grand a month and told him to come back to me about pay when he was in the green.<br><br>He obviously took that offer in a heartbeat. Then I finished deep cleaning the kitchen (he&#39;d be in there with me helping do that every night. Kitchens get fucking gross after a busy day). So life went on, he&#39;d come in and help me figure out some of the recipes when I needed help or teach me how to essentially do everything. Then a bit after that we finally got another cook. Guy had to be taught everything and I was the kitchen dude so I had to do most of the teaching. Owner came in a bit but honestly was busy manning sushi most of the time. Thing&#39;s are going okay after a couple months, other guy is to a point where I can lean on him a bit and not stress as much while getting food out of the kitchen and then suddenly he&#39;s fired. Why? No clue. Probably money, possibly because the owner just isn&#39;t feeling it. I get that. I&#39;m solo again and running around 12-14 hours a day near-panicked constantly again.<br><br>New dishwasher comes in, lasts like two weeks, he&#39;s gone. then a while after that we finally get another cook. This dude&#39;s pretty great to work with. He&#39;s got restaurant experience, he can keep up from day 1 and just needs to know recipes and where stuff&#39;s at before he&#39;s kicking ass, man&#39;s a lifesaver. A few months later we get another cook who lasts for like a week before getting re-designated as dish-pit while being allowed to come check on the kitchen and learn a bit when there weren&#39;t dishes. Dish-pit lasts a month and then vanishes. Maybe he quit, who knows.<br><br>Then it happened. Someone decided to have a birthday party. At this point I had already been seeing the signs for a couple weeks of the owner grumbling about the other cook. Why? I have no clue. Probably just didn&#39;t click with the owner. This birthday party though, was a 30 seat table. There were other customers during this too and a LOT of them weren&#39;t there for sushi.<br><br>So, obviously, kitchen gets backed up. We&#39;re two guys who&#39;re used to having maybe as many as 8 heads on the ticket board at once suddenly getting a 30 head ticket who all want appetizers, meals and desserts on top of that constant flow of 2-3 head tables. The food came out a bit late, but it came out. The problem was a matter of having to make sure everything was coming out at the right times and close together and all fresh en mass.<br><br>That shift ended, owner comes in with a stool and takes a seat and starts complaining about the performance. This is after weeks of both of us asking him to find more cooks to man the kitchen so we can have another day off or maybe just work dinners or in case someone got sick. But he&#39;s fucking pissed. Basically we know this shift is going to end with the other cook fired.<br><br>At this point, I can&#39;t be fucked. This was THE guy I needed in there with me, if I was gonna lose him it was going to be hell on earth again and it&#39;d be a while before we found another cook. So, we cleaned up, took off our aprons and coats, folded them up and walked out. I probably wasn&#39;t getting fired but I wasn&#39;t going to let the guy leave alone and I wasn&#39;t going to handle going back to flying that ship solo.<br><br>Talked to the owner like a year later, he understood why it happened and there&#39;s not really any hard feelings. Place is still running and while the last time I had their food the kitchen wasn&#39;t quite up to the standard I had stuff coming out at (sauces not reduced enough, etc) it was still pretty damn good.<br><br>Not saying it&#39;s the same deal as a company treating people like shit, but hearing about the whole Blizzard 600 incident reminded me about that."
642,"back in early 2000&#39;s I worked for a gaming company and they had to layoff a lot of staff because of a bad business decision, and they put us into a small room to allow those that were being fired time to leave.  Turns out they made a mistake and many but not all of us in the room were fired too.  It&#39;s such a weird cattle call to be fired.  <br><br>In another company during pandemic when I was doing tech support, we were converted to WFH and it was such a great success for the company many if not all the middle management were let go.  Didn&#39;t affect our workflow in the slightest.  With all the tools at our disposal there was no need for them anymore.  I wonder if that trend will continue, I guess it depends what kind of company you&#39;re in or what vertical you&#39;re stuck in.  Our notion of work and time for yourself is changing and I hope WFH becomes the norm not the exception.  <br><br>Great chat, great lessons <br>Cheers"

646,"Microsoft treats employees as numbers. I don&#39;t know how they handle every game studio they manage, but when the 343 employee cuts were happening a few months after Halo Infinite Launched, I read a bunch of the posts from the employees that were leaving. The basic jist was that half of the developers are contractors, they have a clause that says they have to hire those contractors if they work for Microsoft more than 1 year straight. So Microsoft would end the contract just before 1 year, and then hire a new contractor. They did this through Halo Infinite&#39;s production, and it is one of the biggest reasons I saw, for why the game was delayed so much, and why they cut a lot of the campaign from the launch."

Often, they&#39;ll be less likely to jump to the defense of the lower-ranking people whether due to who they believe is more valuable or who the personnel are most familiar with, but in theory they are not beholden to the managers but to the corporation itself.

662,"QA is absolutely part of engineering. Devs can and should test and certify their work, but no one or group is perfect. QA is an incredible discipline that is not at all easy. A qualified QA tech is worth their weight in gold. A subtle thing in the software industry (really, any industry where you build something) is that defects are cheaper to fix when you catch them early. This is as true for a video game as it is for a website as it is for a skyscraper (maybe more important for the skyscraper, lol). 90% of the time, crappy software is because the culture of the development team (devs + QA + product managers + project manager) undervalues QA. I absolutely appreciate the QA folks that I&#39;ve worked with in the past. And yeah, it&#39;s hard to be told that you messed something up, but if you take it personally, you&#39;re dealing with nothing but pure pride."

It really bothers me (and most people I think) when companies are this blatent about it especially ones that are clearly trading on the fact the idea that anyone would love to have your job, so you should be thankful and just take what you are so nicely given...<br>edit: Oh wait, this guy is in the UK!

Everyone on nights were then moved to days and we HAD to take a 2.5% pay cut (We lost our shift diff) out of a 13 person team only 2 stayed. I was the first to leave because I lived 50 miles from the office in a different state, and commuting my normal shift was 1 hour and 45 minutes in (not bad) and 30 minutes going home, now I&#39;d spend 4 hours in traffic everyday for less money, and more responsibility.

707,I‚Äôm not gonna lie. When I hear a game dev doesn‚Äôt make very much on his starting job. Makes me feel very little. Those baggers provide a better and more useful service than you. By like a wiiiiiiiiide margin.
708,shut up and let  the  man speak
709,Blizzard biggest mistake was hiring an army of sjws to begin with.
710,Hey. You guys are criticizing a relatively small corporate mess for being too big. Gotta wonder what your sentiments are with respect to the government. &quot;That&#39;s different?&quot;
711,Eff em. Insane. Just worse and worse the more we hear every single time.
712,Ever since I can remember people told me stories of how they slept in their car or slept on a couch to work at blizzard.  They would sell it like &quot;this is how passionate you should be about games to join the industry&quot;.  Looking back I can&#39;t believe how brainwashed we all were like why was this cool with games like Starcraft and Warcraft that can be found in every gamer&#39;s home.
713,"I was managing a team of electrical/electronic designers at a robotics company. The engineering manager promoted me to lead and shortly after wanted <i>daily</i> updates for every single person under me, 11 people. I had to include everything that was completed every day for a project - micromanaging to the extreme, budget spent, budget remaining, blockers, foreseeable problems, and dependency issues with other departments like mechanical engineering.<br><br>The report used to take me an hour to do, every day, because I&#39;d have to peruse every members email brief and then formulate it in to a report. My team was billing around 10 minutes every day, or an hour a week, and I was booking around 5 hours a week to non-billable hours. We worked for clients like BP, ConocoPhillips etc and everything we did was booked to project. After a few weeks the engineering manager tried to redress me because anywhere up to 20 hours per week were being book to overheads, non-billable hours, and the company was literally losing money for that time. I refused to let my team book the admin hours to projects because we then faced overrunning our project budget because finance was unaware of our manager&#39;s requirements and didn&#39;t factor in those additional costs when estimating for costing.<br><br>The situation got a lot worse, the micromanaging became unbearable, the unreasonable nature of what was asked vs how it was to be charged became comical and I eventually handed in my notice. I also happened to be the CAD manager, looking after the network infrastructure as well as the VM&#39;s and license managers for the companies AutoCAD requirements.... queue the engineering manager calling me multiple times a week for a few months after I left trying to get me back - or at least trying to get me to explain <i>how</i> to do my job! Thankfully I&#39;d already secured a position at an aerospace engineering company as a weapon systems engineer and simply couldn&#39;t give two hoots about the old manager&#39;s problems. I just ignored all his emails to my personal address, all his voice mails, all his text messages, and left him on his merry way.<br><br>Hopefully he learnt not to sh!t on the people he actually depended upon to get projects completed. But if he didn&#39;t.... who cares? Not my problem any more. I&#39;m on significantly more money now and my manager now is an absolute legend. Not quite the heinous story as in this video, but still evident of problems at all levels in lots of companies across the board in all industries."
714,Thats crazy you live in Rapid City - I was just living there for a few years until recently - wish I had known
715,You&#39;re jerks! AAA is great! Especially when americans come to manage someone they don&#39;t even consider humans (basically 99 percent of the world). <br>Just look at the glassdoor - everythinh is great! Stop complaining.
716,&quot;you have the name but you dont have the game&quot; wow soo true
717,Listening about badge color apartheid at Blizzard was definitely not something I was expecting to hear today
718,can I get a TL;DW? genuinely interested but not enough to watch an hour and 20 minute video
719,"god damn, this explains so much... this is why blizzard products feel like they havent been play tested at all. they pay and treat qa like theyre dumb fucks with no skill so they get qa that feels like its been done by dumb fucks with no skills"
720,"When Chris Sayers said that he realized Blizzard doesn&#39;t care about people, that&#39;s not really a strong enough description. There&#39;s a difference between just not caring about people, and actively holding contempt for them to such a degree that you think it&#39;s okay to do this kind of shit to them. That&#39;s not just callousness. That&#39;s contempt."
721,This video helped me make a really important decision. Thank you.
722,"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KGQSTDm5ois&amp;t=2675"">44:35</a> I worked in a classified area (a scif) and people tailgated all the time. People who didn&#39;t know me definitely let me in just cause my badge was the right color."
723,A lot of this mirrors things I dealt with as an AppleCare advisor. <br><br>They&#39;re all scum.
724,"Speaking of enjoyment in the entire realm of video games, I just wish that I could still enjoy gaming. I&#39;ll start, and within maybe an hour or so, I just get bored.<br><br>The only hobby I have left that I actually enjoy is reading manga and light novels, and I pray that my interest doesn&#39;t wane. It&#39;s pretty much all that I have left."
725,I also work in quabity ashuwits
726,Leadership is a lateral move so CEO should earn as much as a yellow badge
727,"Yeah, I had a similar experience in the gaming industry at a completely different place that I unfortunately do not feel comfortable naming (it got bought out by a big name company and honestly, ugh).<br><br>I was a QAE.  For those that don&#39;t know what that means, what that boils down to is:  I had to come in about an hour before the QA Team, and if I didn&#39;t do my job, no one worked (or if they did they did so on an out of date build).<br><br>I had my first child while working at this company, participating (and being of significant assistance to launching two MMOs, as well as working sometimes on another MMO, admittedly veerrrrry infrequently).  I wanted to switch my schedule so that I didn&#39;t have to pay very expensive childcare (we worked non-standard hours, so daycare costs were going to be even more expensive than &quot;normal&quot;).  I got told no, because the VP wanted someone who &quot;was trained&quot; in the things I&#39;d be doing in the new position (despite literally doing the work I&#39;d be doing over there and writing the documentation for doing launches, assisting with multiple international launches, etc).  The person who would be my manager wanted me, because I knew the stuff, and anything I didn&#39;t know they knew they could easily teach me.<br><br>So, sadly I left (as garbage as it was, it was my first job, my dream job, and something I wanted to do professionally).  When I left, they took my job out of QA and moved it to the department I was wanting to move to....<br><br>And yeah, QA gets treated like garbage.  I had &quot;devs&quot; come over when I was there off hours (we were allowed and encouraged to play other MMOs and allowed to use company machines if we didn&#39;t have ones at home that could manage it) and DEMAND I do work (off the clock, unpaid) and then when I told them to go away and leave me alone (admittedly not as graceful as I could have been) they went to the VP to complain about me, instead of my manager.<br><br>And yeah, I had so many things that I put together and made myself out of spare &quot;parts&quot;, 5+ versions out of date documentation / etc... I had SO MANY THINGS automated, much like @PirateSoftware did.<br><br>Many many years later I&#39;m glad I left, but I&#39;m also sad.  The people I worked with immediately were for the most part nice people.  I&#39;m still friends and in contact with many of them.  But I&#39;ll never go back, and I do what I can to at least make sure that people know what they&#39;re getting into."
728,"are all game programmers woke now?  I see a trend that most are a part or support the rainbow trans mafia, have pronouns in name, etc.  Is this why so many games and thier story lines suck these days?"
729,"Tustin, Irvine with crime lmaooo.  Tustin is nice compared to LB.  But I get it lol"
730,"I hate to hear how this guy was threated, because it is very common on corporate"
731,"&quot;Don&#39;t quit the work, quit the job.&quot;<br>That rings so true with me. In my early 20&#39;s I ran a small business doing tech support and electronics repair. When I left I said &quot;I&#39;m never doing IT or related work again. I hate it, I&#39;m done.&quot;<br>Now, in my 30&#39;s, I&#39;ve realized I never hated the work. The work was my passion. I hated the job of small business management."
732,He/him<br>No sympathy
733,"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KGQSTDm5ois&amp;t=2993"">49:53</a> Location based pay - assuming it means pay based on what country, what region, what your local living expense is and not some US term - is to also take local purchase power into the equation. If you take the annual income of a mid-tier household (forgot the actual term) in the US and spend it in Thailand, you can get so much further for the money because the purchase power is lower and living expense is lower.<br><br>Similarly if you advocate that a worker in Zimbabwe in Africa should get the same pay as the one in the EU - lets say one of the highest living expense countries like Norway - that person in Norway is going to starve or the one in Zimbabwe is going to be living high, because there&#39;s a vast difference in living expense. And you really don&#39;t want companies to select which way that would go, because the US and EU are parts of the more expensive places to live in and if you equalize pay to that of other countries... say goodbye to any luxury goods. No TV, no phone... you&#39;re going to be scrapping to get by if you don&#39;t do that already.<br><br>Check a comparison site of consumer prices/living expenses between the US/UK/France and something like Thailand. Between the US and Thailand, general consumer goods are double as expensive in the US. Rent is near 150% more than Thailand."
734,"The same thing is true in the IT world with help desk. Treating help desk as garbage employees who know nothing and pay the bare minimum (usually while dumping sys admin tasks on them) leads to super inconsistent and shit results. Sure it&#39;s great to farm sharepoint devs and infrastructure and sysadmin and even full stack or devs from help desk when the talent shows itself, but the difference to your IT organization when it has GOOD help desk and SHIT help desk is night and fucking day. It&#39;s a force multiplier in either direction for everyone else on the team. Help desk that properly documents and asks the right questions and can follow instructions and better yet write instructions will save so much time and money - and yet, most orgs don&#39;t want to do that. They got people who&#39;ve been doing help desk for 20 years replacing keyboards and it&#39;s fuckin stupid."
735,I spent my childhood trying to make StarCraft maps and it inspired me to fail out of game design school. Thanks Blizzard.
736,I still don&#39;t understand how Mike Morhaime didnt know any of this. Even just the way those people were fired...he didnt know? I dunno.
737,"Didn&#39;t expect to watch a whole ass hour-plus video, but it&#39;s a damn fascinating discussion."
738,Bros... this is like some insider devs coffee talk I&#39;m listening too.üëë
739,I worked as QA for the now defunct THQ for about a year as a contract worker.  Let me just say that it was one of the absolute worse things to do in life.  You&#39;re treated exactly as described which is a monkey with a keyboard or in my case a controller.  When you hit crunch time which was a lot of the time you&#39;re working 80-100 hours a week for 7 days a week.  It was so bad that I would just call in sick every other Sunday because it was just that bad.<br>The crazy part about it is that you had people who LOVED it.  I was not one of those people but because you had people who loved it everyone was abused.

748,"The comic community went through this recently on twitter. I couldn‚Äôt believe how ignorant ppl are to how abhorrently creatives were treated by their own industry for decades, given how huge the MCU is and killed the industry it owes its existence to. famously so and since the beginning. Burning and destroying or stealing original art to sell for their own gain, no credit on their work, underpaid and overworked. Every industry is the same. Icons of the medium with 30+ years experience going to cons only to leave becuase ‚Äòfans‚Äô had no idea where they were even when the movie they love is directly based on the book they created. For example the spider verse owes its entire visual character design to an artist called John Romita jr, an industry Tirana and he receives zero credit.

751,"I&#39;m amazed at how the games industry seems to treat QA as a place to cut corners and devalue employees. I do QA for major organization&#39;s in-house product development team and am treated with respect, compensated well and am considered an equal on the team along with the devs and product managers. It is assumed that QA is vital and thus must be treated as such. Of course, the organization has to use the software; these AAA game companies don&#39;t have to use their product, just sell it. I guess that&#39;s the difference."
752,He/Him...<br><br>Unsubbed
753,"Being american must be funny. Anyways. One thing the guy said: &quot;QA, but what if I dont have people skills ?&quot;.<br>A dev dont need you to do QA if you cant understand what the people want. A dev knows how to do what they do, and how to make it work as they want. The problem is to make something that &quot;other people&quot; will like or wont harm themselves or others with it. QA without people skills is like saying you are a spokesman but you cant speak to people, just talk &quot;things&quot;.<br>And Idk where does these people take that &quot;doing what you want&quot; is the definition of a successful business. I might not like them, but I have heard about Blizzard, about Amazon games, about Valve, but I have never heard of half of these studios people say &quot;I left X Y or Z and my studio is not better&quot;. Honestly, as a developer, I even should have heard about those things, as I have about many other smaller projects and etc. But I dont reallly know how they talk about being more &quot;successful&quot; as a business. If you are happier working your way, good for you. That is not a definition for a succesful business. Business and people are two different things. I DO WORK for myself, doing what I want, and luckly being paid (sometimes not) for it, but I would never say I have a successful business, because that is exactly the choice you do for success. To work FOR OTHERS you must do things you dont like. That is how it is."

758,"Yeah, nah. &quot;Leadership is a lateral move&quot; is complete BS. Maybe you have the same impact, but the responsibilities and type of work change, as do the expectations of the comapny on you.<br>As a regular worker, you do your part and everything else is none of your business.<br>In a leadership position you&#39;re responsible for your job and that of everyone below you. If your team screws up, that&#39;s on you. Saying it&#39;s a lateral move because your impact on the company doesn&#39;t change makes no sense.<br><br>As for locking him out, that makes sense. They know they bent him over a barrel and had their way with him. He just resigned. The only other steps he has here are &quot;sit down and take it&quot; or &quot;talk to a lawyer&quot;. The first thing the lawyer will say if he has a case is &quot;get all the evidence&quot;, which would mean chatlogs, emails, the lot.<br><br>So what do companies do when they screw you over like that? They lock you out of everything to A) prevent you from stealing proprietary information or sabotaging anything and B) prevent you from collecting any evidence you could use against them in court that you do not already have saved elsewhere.<br><br>If you&#39;re going to put a line in the sand, make sure you have a copy of every bit of paper that matters because companies WILL lock you out and &quot;lose&quot; stuff."

763,"That&#39;s how it is in manufacturing too. We have a saying at my work. &quot;Fuck up, move up&quot; idiocy promotes idiocy and the worst of the worst corporate shill bean counters keep climbing the ladder leaving the talented techs, QA, and engineers that could make the right choices and changes behind, and they are left with crumbs and crumbling prospects"
764,This sounds exactly like the toxicity you see in corporate manufacturing jobs all the time. It&#39;s everywhere

795,Are there no laws in america? Blizzard literally abused women so much that tehy killed themselves and nothing happened. and now hundreds of storys about more abuse and nothing happens?
796,"it&#39;s funny how HR is quite often the most inhumane part of a company. just don&#39;t accept people who wanna do HR, and make it a revolving role with company-wide lottery."
797,You completely misqoute dantes inferno. It does say that but it means if you have hope you get trapped in hell. Avatar the last airbender used the same qoute when they crossed the serpents river.

809,THEY CAN&#39;T KEEP GETTING AWAY WITH THIS!!
810,NO WAY
811,im really glad that he made thor explain all those terms -- usually thor does that but I would have been pretty lost without the context and definition
812,"I think at a certain point, these issues aren&#39;t &quot;Company&quot; issues. They&#39;re just societal issues. Like, you&#39;ve got 13,000 people working there. This is A SMALL TOWN&#39;s worth of people. This is larger than colleges. This is 5x larger than most High Schools. It&#39;s fucking massive. And we should be treating it more similarly. You can&#39;t just go up to a town, see a murder, and then say, &quot;Damn, I can&#39;t believe that Mayor let that happen.&quot;"
813,"My perfect D&amp;D party is 3 people, I mostly run with just two other guys I know really well. We can play anything we like and we always have a great time."
814,Getting rid of all the old sweaty geeks that made good games is why blizzard went downhill. Almost every tech company replaced sweaty anti-social geeks that could make great games and great artwork with gender study grads and HR reps so that their company looks better at first glance to investors due to a &quot;high diversity&quot; despite how artificial it is.
815,Those practices going unchecked for so long is exactly how we got where we are now.
816,I had the same experience growing up in the 90s - Blizzard was one of the biggest incentives for me to start studying dev back then
817,"Being in IT is the same shit.<br>replaceable blah blah blah.<br>Sales and devs are the rockstars, not the guys that fix the shit."
818,"Funny thing I was interviewed by Blizzard and passed, they took a while to actually talk about the offer only VERBALLY said I passed. Then a month goes by and the recruiter out of the blue when I had forgotten about it reach out to me to ask if I&#39;m interested. I ask him that my only concerns is &quot;quality of life&quot; since I&#39;m Canada based as of right now and I would have to move to US, and comparing Irvine to where I live it would kinda suck. He said, with the most broken look I&#39;ve seen a recruiter &quot;no your quality of life will very likely become a lot worse&quot;. Thanks recruiter, you made me dodge a bullet. The project I was hired for was cancelled weeks ago and the entire team let go."

821,"Blizzard was rough - they hired women and teh women accused all the brilliant people who did everything that made the company&#39;s games worht playings of some bs, so they all were fired - and now the games will suck forever.<br><br>Sabotage."

823,"oh gods, coloured badges, that shits toxic as hell, worked 3 places that used that and... was one of 3 people who caused the owner to abolish the system, one day i was waiting on a delivery to be able to do my job... and heard him talking about a problem they had.. having nothing better to do i went over.. both got the computer system working again, and spent a few hours getting things setup so that what happened wouldnt happen again, i had ZERO exp with this stuff just.. life long tech geek and able to figure shit out and read a fckn manual..... <br><br>owner saw my badge and was confused as.... i wasnt part of the staff who should have even been there... let alone been able to fix it before they could get a tech out from the company to fix it.. when he asked why, and how i did it.. &quot;i heard you complaining about 2 weeks of down time before they could get somebody out to fix the computer that controls these damn things... and computers are soft of my thing...&quot;  ended up moved from a job that was often what amounted to busy work, to one that used my skills, he also realized how his staff had been dismising anybody with a lower badge...even if you made more then they did... something else he discovered by removing that was, people who were getting undue respect started to show their true colours and could either be corrected or would often  quit because they felt entitled to act like a &quot;rockstar&quot; (whats with that word and dbags? because no joke i have heard it from  dbag dev types and their managers more then a few times...)... <br><br>i know a few people who worked for blizzard over the years, 3 worked for blizzard north and shifted to ca..then moved back north because living expenses made their pay &quot;hike&quot; a net loss.. and the working conditions sucked, lots of meaningless overtime as the video pointed out , busy work testing stuff you knows broken.. just to be doing something... and often it being overtime... that makes zero sense... why are you running over time when you got nothing thats ready to test and debut?<br><br>honestly, they all said blizzard north was a much better experience, 2 only heard about it but EVERYBODY agreed it a very different environment, disconnected from south by a lot of physical distance...   <br><br>they all told people who were being treated unfairly to find other work when in CA, and even got a few hired at studios that sprouted up from the closure of blizz north, why?  because if you see talent... and can nab it up, even if you gotta pay so it can move... one of the best debuggers they hired was sure he sucked at debugging because of how he was treated... his boss was taking credit for his work it later turned out, she was making nice bonuses for doing her job and other peoples... when he quit and took the 3k offered to move...he and his GF, GF&#39;s sister and his cousin who were all sharing a small place, moved up to the seattle area where the place ended up hiring them all, buddies now wife got hired to manage the old hotel they turned into employee housing, wifes sister turned out to be shite at writing her own code but she can re-write and optimize other peoples code with ease, we realized after getting her stoned what the problem is.. she cant decide what the best way to start doing any given task is.. she gets stuck in a mental loop trying to calculate the best way to do the task...where most people just do whatever is the least effort and let somebody else deal with debugging/optimization (or so im told..) <br><br>on the other hand, my buddy ended up getting hired for a job title they came up with after reviewing his skills, and let him form a team from the new hires and from the people not in teams or looking to move.. their whole job was to optimize and debug said optimizations, a few times they had to take on debugging because code the were sent was such a cluster-fck and rats nest that.. it was easier to have the team just re-write the code then try and debug it or get the main debugging teams deal with it. many of them were not really suited to re-writing a whole application....(they finely got the company to stop contracting indian and middle eastern coding firms to &quot;speed development&quot; since over 80% of what they got from  them had to be re-written to a heavy degree to just function.. so it wasnt really speeding dev.. it was adding more work... on example was them getting back an application that was just designed to sync multi folders/network folders/drivees.... the person wrote it in java... it was not good... due to poor memory management it would,not memory leak so much as just fill memory with junk till the system ran out of memory... took a highghschool intern 3 days to write something better in C# that could be deployed to all their system that needed it, <br><br>oh  and why did they do this?  because the commercial software they paid over 30k for was broken and wouldnt keep all sources in sync, and after 9mo of them saying it would be fixxed in the next update.... they decided they needed to just do something themselves... apparently the kid just used a couple open source projects and re-wrote parts to do what he needed, and made a very simple but functional UI for it... and earned himself a full hire before he was even out of HS...  because... 3 days... 3 bloody days and it needed no patching till they decided they wanted to get it setup to do the same thing but also over the net to other locations.. in the end the kid just modified syncthing and set it up so it just runs in the background on all invovled systems keeping stuff in sync across the swarm.."
824,Nerds.
825,"I used to love Blizzard Games, but damn if I won&#39;t ever play one again. Certainly not until sexual harrassment, sexism, classism is fixed."
826,"Used to work as a QA in a company that struggled to release anything. It had very separate dev and QA and it hurt lots. We did a side project where I was embedded in the dev team and we released really fast, automated lots of it etc, built new tooling to support faster turnaround of things including the main product. The company were blown away and gave us awards to recognise how much better we worked than the main flow. Then they dissolved our team and told us all to move the side project into working in the segregated way the rest of the company worked. Nothing learned, and basically every member of the team left within 3 months (devs, QA &amp; devops all left, not just QA)."
827,They are not legally allowed to stop him from working in the UK.
828,The Ben Brode example was terrible in terms of how people felt about the game.
829,"I work in IT support and frankly it&#39;s a lot less stressful than development.  I enjoyed programming, but I would never want to work for a company for what&#39;s expected of you for what you get.  I got into programming to work on games and I&#39;m happy I never worked for one of these companies.  I just write some small programs here and there to fix some issues."
830,I can&#39;t believe that we are here today. We are selling complex versions of &#39;paper rock siccors&#39; on processed rocks to people so they can waist time. People are so into games there never this moment of introspection.
831,"Have there been such a thing as &quot;rockstars&quot; in game dev since 16 bit games were a thing? Surely it&#39;s teamwork, good design, scripts and reliability that make a game?"
832,"I was trying to find your channel on Spotify because I just wanted to listen and could not find it. I suggest solving that issue. Other than that this was a great talk, very interesting!"

834,What does blizzard even do nowadays?
835,QA IS engineering...
836,"Ooof, coloured badges = Gear Score in WoW....."
837,Game devs are dumb. This dude tells a story about being abused by his superiors and instead of quitting he pitched a new team to help them. Battered wife syndrome.
838,QA shold be writing tests before developers write any code.
839,"My direct boss transferred to another location and after that for roughly 4 months there was no manager over our team, so me and the other person who had the most time in the job more or less started to just... DO the job of our manager. No pay increase, no benefits, just more work and everything still had to be done even though we were always at least one employee down. This affected my health and I started feeling sick more and more often leading to me missing more and more days (UNPAID time off, I gained NOTHING from missing work), until I just went in and told them I would not do it anymore. I had NO IDEA how stressed out I was because I for a while have had tinnitus off and on again, but the MOMENT I told them that... IT STOPPED, All of a sudden so much stress I had no IDEA i was carrying just fell off. In that same regard the moment I told them that, ever opportunity to do more to earn more pay was absolutely denied to me.<br><br>Needless to say when something better came to me rather than give them the comfortable 2 weeks notice, I quit that day."
840,work as an engineer in a very IP locked industry in the UK. Unpaid non-competes are extremely illegal under british common law. EU law is meaningless because lol brexit but yeah a lawyer would get it removed and a cash settlement for you in about a week.
841,"Overwatch has this exact problem of the devs not playing the game, not understanding the game, etc."
842,I think the fear of an embedded qa was collussion.
843,"Reading the starting tweet this discussion is about reminds me of something that I had to find out myself as well. Something that, sadly, we have to ingrain into people&#39;s heads: HR is not here to help you. Period. The purpose of HR is to vet potential new hires and to keep the company from being held liable from employee&#39;s claims. They are there to protect the company from you, not the other way around. This goal only aligns with your own sometimes if it&#39;s against another employee."
844,"There are a few things I did as an adult that I wish someone did for me when I joined the workforce, and one of them is that every time I get to talk to any intern, I give them &quot;the talk&quot;. Even though I live in a country that has fairly strict labour laws, shit still happens and I make it a point to tell them &quot;don&#39;t do any work without a contract, ask for confirmation of all promises in writing, when someone wants you to do something big or complex, ask them for detailed specification of what they want in an email so they can&#39;t later say they asked for something else&quot; and one of the things I sometimes hear on that is &quot;well won&#39;t that make me not liked by managers?&quot; and my answer is always &quot;The only people who have any problem with that are people who want to screw you over&quot;. I&#39;ll have to add &quot;HR is there to protect the company, not you&quot; to this list cause that&#39;s brilliant."
845,"The exception is not the rule, and QA is not engineering. QA is really important but words have meaning"
846,"Listening just to the first 10 minutes, my first job as a dev was like the dudes at blizz same as minimum wage 12-14 hour days since I joined at the first 3rd of crunch time. <br>After 3 months I just forgot to turn up. That&#39;s not a life"

849,"In the US Legal Eagle on youtube is friendly and says to contact him and he will try and help.  <br><br>I spent years doing volunteer QA for games.  My first bug was in MajorMUD (I was so proud of that).  City of Heroes, Warcraft (Through Pandaria), Starwars Galaxies, later Star Trek Online, Starwars the Old Republic.  <br><br>I applied to Blizzard and several other companies and got an interview with folks at Blizzard.  They liked my approach and how Id test things but said Im not a good fit.  I asked them for advice on improving my resume off the record if needed.  The guy said off the record your too old - we need young people only they can work as hard as we need.  <br><br>So I gave up on working in games.  I still pick apart how games are laid out, quest directions, etc, for fun."

868,"My first job in Australia back in 2007 was just working in the kitchen helping doing dishes and occasionally on the floor or at the till as well, starting salary for my age was $18.90, I mean yeah that&#39;s Aussie dollars but still. That&#39;s crazy how much he was getting in 2009 in America working for f***ing Blizzard of all places. I guess the only positive thing you can argue with that is that hey at least it will look good on your resume that you worked at Blizzard, so it&#39;s good on paper for your career, but only as a stepping stone so u could find something better later or start your own thing."
869,"The strangest thing no one seems to notice, and a lot should, is why there is never a QA representative during a developer panel at a gaming convention that players can talk to. <br><br>Developers will tell people to mainly enter in through QA, but then there is no one from QA to talk to them about what they do at the company, as no QA is ever the same."
870,"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KGQSTDm5ois&amp;t=1500"">25:00</a> yeah that&#39;s what you get when you have shitty labor laws.

871,"I hear companies looking to hire SDETs (Software Development Engineers in Test) or Automation QA and complain they have a hard time finding anyone. Yes, because all those who are skilled to do that are also skilled enough to be Software Developers. And guess which class of developer gets paid more."

884,"This makes me want to never play a blizzard game ever again, I&#39;m so glad I haven&#39;t. They don&#39;t even have the common decency to approach the team as a whole and say hey look, we have an exit package we need to get rid of 2 of you any volunteers on this package and then if not, you go by seniority. Downsizing and layoffs are understandable but damn..... This is a disgusting practice."

LinkedIn was just a mess off people saying that they lost their jobs, and it was just sad knowing that a bunch of my friends, mainly that i won&#39;t get to work with them. I am still working on projects with out them and it is just strange. <br>I worked in IT at Amazon (in a whorehouse) and then going to working at a game studio, my manager did something similar to what yours did. Because I was use to the culture of backstabbing at Amazon that i had retrain my brain to not always be  on edge and in defense mode. Now I have friends that i work with that I don&#39;t have to worry about going behind my back for stupid things."

901,"I will never forget Kil Jaeden during the Legion Expansion, who the devs promised was totally working and they could totally kill it easily with their in-house raid team led by the game director at the time Ion Hazzikostas, only to watch the boss despawn every time it was supposed to change phases because they had no QA on team 2 and kept breaking the entire game on a weekly basis."
902,Hearing how Blizzard is run really tells you how they were not able to make a good game for like 15 years now. Working for Blizzard is how I imagine hell.

I checked  my pay check by chance 1 day and noticed that for that hour I would stay over to work the freight, I was only getting paid $8, they where removing my overnight differential for that time."

909,"Honestly, Blizzard&#39;s internal culture and practices like this show in the final product of their games and that&#39;s a huge part of why I can&#39;t stand any of their products in recent years. Toxic companies make toxic experiences as much for their players as for their employees."
910,"So I own a business, obviously not as big as Blizzard, but re: low man on the totem pole (with the accommodations), as much as it sucks, it&#39;s totally understandable and should be for anyone objectively looking at it. Making a lot of accommodations for a long-time employee or for a high level one is one thing. making a lot of accommodations for a new hire at a low level of the totem pole is a whole different thing altogether. When I have hired people, I have absolutely had to turn people away who I wanted to hire but I just could not make accommodations. Think about if you are a supervisor at a construction site and a great candidate comes across your desk BUT they live a city away and have no vehicle. What do you do? It&#39;s a very difficult decision to make but sometimes you have to make tough choices. I don&#39;t necessarily think it&#39;s fair to shit on a company for not wanting to make accommodations to their policies.<br><br>At a small company, it may be easier to pivot and make accommodations, but for a big company, suddenly there are issues. If you let this guy do it but not another guy, the other guy could sue over it. Etc. Who knows what systems were in place or what meetings etc might have required being in person. It&#39;s not always as simple as it seems."

916,working 4 peoples jobs... that hits way to close to home :/
917,"Forcing return to Office for someone who has a disaiblity, like needing to stay home is illegal and disability discrimination ESPECIALLY in California. The company has to prove if would be an un-due hardship for you to continue to do your job from home which is impossible to do if you&#39;ve been doing your job from home for months. It pisses me off so much that people don&#39;t know how this."
918,"HR is there to protect the company, provide the resources needed to do the work at the lowest attainable cost, and to manage the benefits they are actually willing to provide.  Some people in HR only do the last and think of themselves as proactive for the employees without realizing that they are working for an evil department.  Evil by design, but this is a top down issue.  Top management has to keep them in check or you get these stories.  I&#39;ve seen this time and again."
919,"if blizzard employees get treated and paid so badly why are some of their game masters .. whats the term... blizzards lapdogs i guess? GMs harrassed TF outta me while i was still playing WoW and i just HAD to quit. they just didnt want me playing their games for some reason. when overwatch came out it was the same experience. ceaslessly harrassed over jokes or even explaining to new people how to play, or even calling out hackers. i just had to give up. in the last email exchange before i quit and uninstalled everything i told them theyd eventually get sued for how they treat people. this was before the whole &quot;cosby bedroom&quot; thing surfaced. and a few years later... i get to enjoy their company falling apart."
920,How you solve this is is with unions and works councils. The only way to balance bad mangers and HR protecting them is by having a mighty counterbalance that has a say in all matters employment.
921,3 black badges!? That&#39;s insane! I knew Thor was legit but three black badges legit is an epic level. I would love to hear the story about those badges!

925,"So Test can get ahead of Dev, in a sense. You can have completed your prep work for backlog items that dev hasn&#39;t started yet. It also kind of requires the dreaded water-scrum-fall process, so it&#39;s a good thing that it happens rarely."
926,"Its hard for people to grasp a very real fact, you as an employee are EXPENDABLE. People really think companies and employers care about you?, oh my lord.<br>I have been in the workforce for 20 years, i have never been employed by a company for anything else but to make them money, period. <br>If im a cost, im out. That is the reality. And they will try to abuse the employee as much as they can get away with.<br>A simple solution is to flat out refuse extra work or quit. I know, ive always either refused to be exploited or quit my job because of it. My mental health is worth alot more than a job."
927,"Never accept new work or anything extra, unless the new contract has been verified in writing and signed before you start it. Never ever make contracts verbally."
928,"I love that line. &quot;Treat your customers with respect, and treat your employees the same.&quot; I worked retail for years before finding my current entry-level IT job, and my last retail location I had a job that I loved, but the pay was below living wage, I was forced out by my managers for fresh blood that started at a higher wage than I had(I had been there for 2 years without a raise), and the company would always take the side of the customer when it came to complaints, no matter how ridiculous they were. It was always &quot;Make the customer happy.&quot; Someone complains? Make them stop by bending to their demands. I had a few people who had unfounded complaints against me, and they resulted in me being pulled into the office for a chat where I needed to supply my version of the situation, and even though it was usually favorable on my end, I always felt like I was being reprimanded. The entire time I was there, it was a fight for more hours, and a constant question as to why I wasn&#39;t making the sales goals that the company had decided I needed to make. My position was an hourly paid position, but also had a commission aspect, which is I think why I never received a raise. The theory of that I don&#39;t need a raise due to my commission. My commission was over half of my pay, and I was only making on average $250-300/week(sales commission included), which made it really difficult to pay my bills. I also for the whole two years, tried to go full-time, almost begging my managers for more hours, hours that I would never receive. At the end, our manager was changed out for a new manager, who started telling me that she didn&#39;t have enough hours to keep scheduling me as much as she was, and I started seeing my hours consistently decreasing. The previous manager, the one who hired me had been honestly trying to get me more hours, but the new manager just seemed to be trying to get me to quit."
929,"hmm, if it was all really true, he could easily take them to court over it, we have stricter rules for employers in the uk and you can just take them to court for harassment and being forced to quit, they also cant stop you working, its against employment law, if all was true he could have taken them to court for 100k+, i think a few fibs are in there, not saying blizzard if a good employer but something doesnt add up with that guys story."
930,"Some of these issues are just universal I feel. Corpo whores trying to drain you for everything you&#39;re worth without any care for your humanity. At my other workplace the QA was absolutely trash, they never check anything, and anyone who actually does anything well just doesn&#39;t get the support they deserve. This is just common all around, the people doing the job correctly get passed over, they aren&#39;t given promotions, they aren&#39;t incentivised with more money. So the good ones leave and what are you left with? Just the shit, and the shit is willing to do shit jobs coz they&#39;re shit. So the shit rises to the top and becomes floating shit in a sea of other floaters. Then the company starts to fall apart in every area because incompetence is being pushed into leadership positions, and everyone suffers for it, especially the customers."
931,"I want to say that the non-compete he signed wouldn&#39;t be enforceable, even in the US. A lot of stories I&#39;ve read about non-competes, they get thrown out because they are overly broad or have a lack of compensation for the non-compete period. It really depends a lot on the local laws and regulations. If you ever find yourself in that situation, talk to some form of employment legal representation to see what your options are."
932,... and this is why I left &#39;zon after 9.5 years on the social media team. The do-nothing corporate parasites and fake-it-til-your-next-promotion crowd are truly revolting.
933,"I&#39;m going to disagree on just one point. HR&#39;s the devil as an organization. Maybe it&#39;s a scale thing, but every company I&#39;ve ever seen go to shit that I started out with? As soon as HR professionals get involved, everything goes to hell. The mark of the beast is a sign telling you where the HR department is."
934,Thank you for talking so openly about this.
935,Unfortunately never got to play any Blizzard games growing up. Sounds like it was a blast.

941,Reducing your pay without even telling you isn&#39;t even legal.  That&#39;s straight-up wage theft.

943,"Non-compete clauses are legal, but so are prenups, and they get tossed out all the time.<br>Break it and fight the lawsuit if they actually bother to pursue, usually they wont, because they almost always lose."
944,"I love this stuff under the hood about Blizzard and even corporate culture in general. I was frontline customer service GM for Wow in the golden age from 2007-2010. That opening line about it being the best of times and worst of times is so true, it was simultaneously the coolest and funnest job they also had all the bs from most other jobs.<br><br>I was relating about all this the other day so it&#39;s fresh in my mind. It&#39;s hard to say how or if things could&#39;ve been different had things happened differently, but I was there for the Activision merger and that was the beginning of the end imo. That was 4 months before wrath dropped for reference.<br><br>I don&#39;t remember this guy&#39;s position, indo t remember his name either, but he was some sort of director, and he was flanked on the stage with a handful of other bright corporate transfers and they were going to change the company and how everything operated. Most of these guys were retired dellionaire dropouts that thought their money came from their hard work and talent. They were in the right place at the right time, and when you&#39;re successful through luck like that, you get your resum√© entry for free and then people grovel at you and your success.<br><br>I remember they interrupted our entire facility for a mandatory meeting in a hotel to watch these assholes self congratulate themselves and talk up the merger. They were all ecstatic because they knew they&#39;d be getting a whole lot of money for nothing. Boomer Dellionaires and customer service executives from airline companies and shit. I remember at the time fuming, because wtf does Amy of that have to do with gaming? Why not promote the people that had already been with blizzard and with wow for years?<br><br>I felt vindicated as most of those people got their stock options for the wrath release and before long had moved on as corporatist vultures. Meanwhile, they had so drastically changed the nature of the customer service we were doing that it made it either impossible, or pointless. Before the merger, GM&#39;s had power, we had to say no a lot, and we had to leave it at that and move on, and we had the authority to do that. Granted, a lot of things later on became integrated in the game experience, like being able to trade BoP items or undelete something accidentally or rage deleted, like characters. Back then it was about the integrity of the game, which seems like such an archaic concept now. We had a whole set of policy rules that were created organically since vanilla launch that we had to adhere to unless the circumstances were exceptional, which was rare. After the merger, we couldn&#39;t say no, we had to say yes but no, we had to do song and dance and make you happy that we said no, and that was &quot;customer service.&quot; Then they added a quality metric, so we were pissing every other person off by trying to make them happy we were saying no, and rventually your metric dips, you get reviewed, and then a temp making 2/3rds of your pay replaces you fresh off the press. When I got there it was a &quot;family company&quot; and people had been there since vanilla launch and some managers there since Diablo 2. When I left it was &quot;every blizzard employee is a future former blizzard employee.&quot;<br><br>#1, at least for a significant amount of time that I recall, was harassment reports. I don&#39;t want to go into too much detail, but I want to say that at least half, if not more of the ticket issues at the time were reports of arguments in public chats. If someone said the f bomb in chat, we&#39;d here about it from 100 different t angles, and we&#39;d have to go through the drudgery of talking every single person that reported. This more often than not pissed people off because it happened hours ago, or even in some cases days ago, and they were busy playing the game. To add insult to injury, we spent most of that late BC and Wotlk period inundated with ticket issues. So they implemented a high tolerance harassment policy. We had to talk to people, tell them we were gonna look at the f bombs and do something, and then do nothing. So like half the workload was utterly pointless and demoralizing. Players knew we didn&#39;t do anything and then we&#39;d talk to them, lie to them, and it pissed them off, and wed get bad quality metrics and our jobs would be at risk. Complete insanity. With some rough math, those sets of policies and the quality metric, must&#39;ve cost blizzard at least $20 million per year paying us to piss their customers off with their own damn policies.<br><br>Besides that, after wotlk, they had us open up on a lot of the old policies, and gave us tools and access to them to start doing pretty common everyday mistakes like character deletions and accidentally traded items etc. So they had us put our problem solving hats and more or less let us have at, partially restoring jacked accounts and stuff to get people back to playing. We had to say yes, which was awesome. The work felt like it had purpose for once. Except for the other half of the workload that was a pure distraction from this crucial element of the game and players experiences. Talking to a quarter million people reporting f bombs per night? Waste of time. Hell, even talking to the people we were helping was mostly a formality and still having to do song and dance. It would&#39;ve been far far better for us to ignore harassments all together (get an email), and for the problems we could solve, just pop in and be like, hey, that thing, we fixed it, have a nice day. But we had to waste precious minutes causing the next person to wait doing the song and dance of customer service lingo. The whole thing was woefully inefficient, more often than not harmed customer service interactions and player experiences, and harmed blizzards reputation."
945,a line manager is indeed a direct supervisor. the &quot;line&quot; references that this manager is in a direct line between who they are responsible for and upper management.
946,"Mike had a policy that would let you talk to him directly if problems we&#39;re being handled by management.<br>Mike knew his middle management was obfuscating issues before they got to him.<br>Mikes response wasn&#39;t the immediate termination of malefactors.<br>Mike clearly WANTED issues to reach a boiling point before they got to him, he condoned ALL of it."

960,I have worked as a Union Boilermaker since 1999. I am a firm believer in Unions! A good  craft steward is worth their weight in gold!
961,"first note the amount of people willing to work at blizzard for 10.50/hr was more than likely 10 times the amount of people that would be a grocery bagger for that rate, you cant really complain about this its simple economics there was alot of people you were competing with for that job lowering the value of that job."
962,"Just to add a little to this, I have been a vfx artist in the games industry for over 20 years, it‚Äôs common for us to have work loads of a few artists, especially when we&#39;re leads. I actually know Chris, he is a great guy and very talented. My concern is that Chris may have been told he was a lead but that could have been project job title and not pay scale increase, its pretty common to have trial positions to see how you do especially if you haven&#39;t done that type of role before. Chris, before he went to blizzard actually had only been at one other studio for 2 years working on fall guys. I am not doubting his capabilities but going from a few years in the industry to lead at blizzard on one of their flagship games seems like this could have been a trial position/ prove your worth position. In my career I have not once seen a non compete clause ever actioned, so whatever went down sounds like blizzard really got their feathers ruffled. As mentioned I really like Chris but we have no idea what he did to actually get blizzard to enforce a non compete. Side note on the pay-scale as well. Companies go by your location, from my experience States/America pay vastly more than the UK. ( i have worked in both regions) <br><br>As for Chris doing his twitter, it‚Äôs great he wanted to get that info out but I also feel he has well and truly burned his bridge with people and possibly other companies, games industry is a tiny place and everyone knows everyone. I actually have horror stories worse than this from big game studios but we have to maintain a level of professionalism as posts like his directly affect people who maybe innocent in all of this."

You&#39;re like 20, you rent a room in an apartment you share with other people, nothing wrong with that.

And just like the guys say never trust HR. Sadly when working these days you need to be working hard to save 3,6, or 12 months of salary because layoffs and misery are the new flavours of company mismanagement. Remember to build your own fulfilment and do work as if everything you do you are learning from it because if you wait for companies to be human or help you grow you will suffer greatly.

Some would go so far as randomly stop us to do a &quot;badge check&quot; I got in trouble more than once over this. Company policy said they could challenge my badge and I had to present it which I did ... Eventually, after about 5 minutes of watching there blood pressure spike. <br><br>The job did pay Better than average but not so much it was worth staying in such a hell hole. I most certainly was not IBM material so I wasn&#39;t a that upset or even surprised when I was let go after 3 months. Frankly I was just happy to never have to set foot in the place again. The only impressive was how arrogant the regular employees were which, for the record, is funny because I&#39;ve still never seen a more useless group of adults accomplish almost nothing everyday while act so self important.

984,"I turned 30 last year and I find my self disheartened by the nonsense going on within Blizzard because everything that Thor has talked about is unfortunately not Blizzard specific. I&#39;ve walked through several companies as a software engineer with just as much moronic management as Blizzard has had. To me, this is unfortunately the norm and I hate it. People much older than me have even told me flat out that this is just the norm. I&#39;ve been given the &quot;if you can&#39;t take the heat, stay out of the kitchen&quot; speech when the only thing I said is, &quot;hey, I&#39;m tired, can we slow down a bit?&quot; I see leaders care only about their quota much more than their own employees. A business still has to run and be profitable, I get that, but why does it have to be at the expensive of your employees? I feel like that&#39;s a fair question to ask and even explore. As I think about starting my own company in the future, I find that Thor is an excellent teacher that gives real solutions to otherwise moronic management tactics and provides health discussions as my generation walks into those leadership positions."

988,back before WoW was released i was right out of high school and wanted to work for blizzard so bad. the only job openings that didnt require an education was being a GM. which i think now the market is so flood with full sail students that now you need to know to code to even be in customer service for blizzard. i think because i was on the east coast my application went right in the trash. i was like hey wouldnt i be more serious about the job if i was willing to relocate across the country just to work for this company? sounds like i really dodged a bullet though because even if i learned to code the way they treat their people.... if you werent part of the OG crew FU i guess

991,That was interesting to listen to. Seems like Mike really was a stand up guy.
992,Q&amp;A trying to be ahead of development. that sounds like how Rare does their sea of thieves test servers. they have people blindly testing nothing without knowing specific things to look for 80% of the time.... and the incentive to test for rare is 3000 in game gold for 1 hour of testing a week. with a 1 hour cap per week so you cant earn more than 1 reward per week..... you can get 3k gold playing the retail server version of the game in about 1 minute
993,Ban Video games..
994,Dude I&#39;m on the IT Ops side but man when you said the go home and reset part. I relate so hard. I moved jobs relatively recently and I don&#39;t feel like I even work because its all at a reasonable pace. It&#39;s been hard to adjusting to just working basically 9-5 instead of also nights and weekends. Not to mention a huge pay bump. Imposter syndrome
995,"Toward the end, where he says &quot;you&#39;re not a bad person, you&#39;re doing a job,&quot; he isn&#39;t correct in the context of the stories they&#39;ve been going over. You can blame bosses for telling you to lie and screw over coworkers/employees, and say &quot;I&#39;m just doing my job,&quot; but the moment you decide to do so, and especially if you don&#39;t care about the victims at all (as the examples showed), you ARE being a bad person.<br>Worry about your own job being at risk, workplace retaliation from bosses, peers, etc. is real, but that&#39;s not a justification for following through with cheating people. Almost any situation/circumstance in life is understandable, and can be given empathy, but that doesn&#39;t change whether it was right/wrong, or whether you&#39;re being a good/bad person toward others through your actions/inactions."
996,"Mmmmm, non compete usually means in a similar business. You were in software, so you could not take another software position. SO in this situation, he should have been able to take a temp job in another field."
997,America is weird when I was in Germany they had paper trails for everything. Americans just don&#39;t and I thought it was normal
998,"for the medical accommodation i would have refuse too its not for his health directly there is no need for that and if he is not a lead in something he made his own grave,"
999,QA was the most draining job of my life.
1000,The H1B grift is not &#39;great&#39; its literally international scabs to crush worker pricing. &#39;Being paid $10 per hour is bad&#39; &#39;third world scab importing is good&#39; PICK ONE
1001,"That test was given to me in 6th grade with the instructions being read everything before starting. The last line said ignore all previous lines which was like stand up and make chicken noises. We knew the dumb kids immediately. Not only did blizzard do the test wrong, they fired the wrong people LOL."
1002,prime asks good questions time to time but he needs to keep quiet more sheesh
1003,"Not to make those about me, but I can relate to the getting laid off through strange criteria.  I worked on a helpdesk in 1996 and the product I was supporting wasn&#39;t doing well such that they didn&#39;t need all of us to support the product.  When I was let go I was asked what criteria they used to lay us off.<br><br>Alphabetically."

1006,"On your mention of the managers at around 19 minutes, it&#39;s important to remember: People don&#39;t really quit their job. They quit their manager. Because in general, it takes a lot of effort finding a new job, getting yourself set right etc again, so most people if they&#39;re treated well, will <b>usually</b> stay where they are. Unless they have someone who got a tiny bit of power and that then entitles them to ruin everyones life around them."
1007,"the badge thing is funny, because these liberal company workers who swear by their vurtue basically reinvent racism the second they see a &#39;lesser badge&#39;"
1008,"I used to DREAM of working for a game dev company, (Blizz WAS my dream back in the day) and thanks to your open honesty about what it&#39;s actually like, there is NO amount of ANYTHING anyone could pay me to work for a non-indie company. As it stands, Thor, you are the ONLY company in software development in existance that I would work for, other than being indie myself."

1010,"&quot;It&#39;s the moderate empathy movement right, they use all these words that sound like they care about you but sound so much worse&quot;<br>It&#39;s because they&#39;re being disingenuous and insincere, and humans are very keen on detecting and disdaining what is artificial/non-natural."
1011,"what happen to game studios and developers in general.<br>They where like the rock stars of programming, people got into the industry largely because of people like John Carmack.<br>But like movie stars they kind of gone away, it&#39;s too corporate."
1012,No wonder so many products turn out to be such trash when the Q/A people can&#39;t even afford to live.
1013,"Halfway houses are not only for people who are getting off drinking. They are for people who are coming out of jail, and/or who have major susbtance abuse problems, and/or who have some form of disability, that need assistance to reintegrate back into society but cannot do it on their own because they have physical, psychological, or legal issues/requirements that need to be met before they can be deemed fit to live on their own.<br><br>Without going in to too many details, that is more or less the gist of it. I just wanted to mention that because it&#39;s not JUST for people who stopped drinking...<br><br>Other than that I totally agree with what you are both saying"
1014,"So what I&#39;m getting from this is that blizzard leadership throughout the entirety of its existence was just absolute dog shit trash dumpster fire and the only way they ever succeeded was to take naive young hopefuls full of passion and use them up and throw them away like they were burning them as gasoline. This company ran on the blood, sweat and tears of innocents.<br><br>wtaf"
1015,"Hey ThePrimeTime,<br><br>Kickin&#39; it at 37 and still deep in the game, literally. Been gaming since I was just a lil&#39; one, sitting on my dad&#39;s lap trying to beat him and his buddy at some classic Pong. Those were the days, man. Grew up with the legends ‚Äì Magnavox Odyssey 2, NES, Sega Mega Drive (or Genesis for the folks in the US), and then the game-changer, the PS1. Man, diving into Resident Evil 1 when I was barely in double digits, and then getting my mind blown by Resident Evil 2 and Silent Hill. Horror was my jam, and my dad was cool with it, no restrictions, just pure, unfiltered gaming as long as I didn&#39;t wake up the house screaming from a nightmare, which I never did.<br><br>Growing up with these consoles was like watching the evolution of gaming firsthand. Each console brought something new to the table, pushing the boundaries of what games could be. It was more than entertainment; it was a revolution happening right in our living rooms.<br><br>But here&#39;s the thing ‚Äì games back then had soul. Developers poured their hearts into these games, creating worlds we could get lost in for hours, days, even weeks on end. It wasn&#39;t just about graphics or mechanics; it was the passion, the story, the whole vibe that pulled you in. Fast forward to today, and it feels like a lot of that magic&#39;s been lost. Too many games now are all about the cash grab, lacking that essence that made the classics so unforgettable.<br><br>It&#39;s like, you play some of these modern games, and they&#39;re shiny and all, but something&#39;s missing. They don&#39;t hit the same way Silent Hill or the OG Resident Evil did. Those games were masterpieces of their time, not just for the gameplay but for the way they made you feel. And don&#39;t even get me started on the remakes ‚Äì it&#39;s like, why mess with perfection? Trying to &quot;modernize&quot; these classics feels like a betrayal, man.<br><br>That&#39;s why I&#39;m all about supporting indie games these days. It&#39;s where you find that passion, that soul that&#39;s missing from so many triple-A titles. Indie devs are out here making games not for the paycheck but for the love of the game. And that&#39;s where the magic happens. That&#39;s where you find games that might not have the polish of a big studio release but have heart, stories that draw you in, gameplay that feels fresh and exciting.<br><br>It&#39;s a trip, seeing how far gaming has come since those days playing Pong on my dad&#39;s lap. But one thing&#39;s for sure ‚Äì no matter how advanced the graphics get or how immersive the worlds become, nothing beats the feeling of playing a game that&#39;s been crafted with passion. So here&#39;s to the indies keeping the spirit of gaming alive, and to all of us who remember where it all started.<br><br>Game on, peeps. üéÆ‚ù§"
1016,"As a person who still lives in Montana, I can confirm its still like that"
1017,Companies who don&#39;t see the value of their employees should implode. <br><br>Was fired once because I messed up and inspection and cost company 1000$. Told my boss he was beyond stupid. Told him you have spent tens of thousands training me. Ive earned you hundreds of thousands of dollars over 5 years. And because of a mistake you will recover from in a week I&#39;m fired? Have fun wasting tens of thousands to regain the knowledge you just lost. <br><br>He tried to backtrack on the firing. I walked out and took the unemployment. They don&#39;t exist anymore. Didnt last 2 years with him in charge
1018,"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KGQSTDm5ois&amp;t=392"">6:32</a> I had a yearly review from my boss once and then at the end they said the CEO wanted me to remind you that everone is replaceable. I paused and looked at her and she shrugged as she knew it was as stupid as it sounded. 2 weeks later I put in my 2 weeks notice and found a job that paid 3x what I was getting paid there. Then got a call three months later that said we really miss you here and the two people we hired to replace you were completely lost. ... well better replace them then ha!"
1019,This was messed up. But the problem is 100% not Capitalism.   It&#39;s actually more Capitalism that would be the solution. We are NOT brainwashed into thinking that the system that runs most economies and always crashes is normal.   There is only 1 type of economy that works and this is it.
1020,"I actually worked with Thor in QA on D3 console. I started in QA in 2008, but was a Game Master for 3 years prior for Blizzard. Yeah. We were told that monkeys could do our job. I were told by the current QA Manager that we were underpaid because they wanted people  who wanted to work for Blizzard and not for just the money. <br>The biggest issue with Blizzard was when Activision acquired Blizzard. They immediately reduced and then almost entirely got rid of Bonus&#39;s. My first Bonus check in QA was in 2008 and was 5000 bucks. My second one was 2500. By 2010, I was getting less than 500. During the first purge, Blizzard said they had their most profitable year ever. Then they removed raises and fired 1000&#39;s of employees, and made it a competitive environment by making people compete for the small percentage of raises that were given out.  Blizzard weas the best company I worked for. Then became the worst company I ever worked for."
1021,its crazy thiey have been getting away with it for more than 15 years
1022,"Whats a good way to irritate the development team, testing stuff that they know is broken and telling them its broken before they asked you to test it :P"
1023,"I really like the idea at <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KGQSTDm5ois&amp;t=1763"">29:23</a>"
1024,"QA here. This still happens, and it&#39;s not unique to Blizzard. I&#39;ve worked for 23 different software development companies, and only one ever treated input from QA as important. Everywhere else, QA is only a checkmark the company has to say they did it and to blame if something goes wrong. I have also seen the whole &quot;get ahead of development b.s&quot;. Management always gets the bright idea to shorten QA time by starting it once stories, and features are written, but before the Dev has even started. As if it were even possible."
1025,omg so thats why Diablo II has such a dark atmosphere
1026,"Bro. I spent 3rd grade through 8th grade in Hardin, MT. I really learned how to defend myself pretty well. We lived in Billings before that, on the side of the tracks you were talking about. You aren&#39;t kidding and that was in the late 80s early 90s. Haven&#39;t been back in awhile, but oh man. Spot on!"
1027,yes. i totally know who mike is :3
1028,Line manager is essentially a supervisor. Just a different way of saying it.
1029,and nowadays we get AAA games with no QA so I guess suits won.
1030,"People don&#39;t quit their jobs, they quit their managers."
1031,WTF employment is F minefield in USA holy shit.
1032,"In regards to HR, still talk to them. While they absolutely are not there to help you but to protect the company, in some (very rare) cases they will be &quot;on your side&quot; because helping you is cheaper/less harmful to the company than the alternative."
1033,"I kind of want to expand on thor saying, &quot;highschool never ends.&quot;<br><br>It sounds like a lot of the kids who had bad social experiences in high school ended up getting some form of power within blizzard and the corporate world enabled them further because they could squeeze employees dry. I mean some of the literal games blizzard management plays with employees where the punishment is getting fired in some dramatic fashion SCREAMS revenge fantasy."
1034,No wonder Blizzard games are garbage.
1035,"OMG, like my two favorite people!"
1036,Nobody with pronouns in their bio has the right to an opinion
1037,"&quot;You&#39;re ActuALLy moved laterally for no extra money with extra responsibilities AND you can&#39;t work for 3 months&quot; REALLY made my blood boil.<br><br>I&#39;m 99.9% sure that it was highly illegal in EU, even if you have signed a contract they would declare it illegal. UK is not in EU anymore, but the laws are very similar because it was in the EU for a long time."
1038,"I know a guy who was a QA tester for Obsidian Entertainment working on Neverwinter Nights 2. At the end of development, they invited all the QA testers to the parking lot for a celebration party. There was no party, they disabled all their keys when they got out there, and told them they were all fired. And that was it..."
1039,"man i still cannot stand livestreams... i was watching some lady play red dead 2, she was crying because its THAT scene where arthur loses his horse... and then &quot;puresoy88 has subscribed&quot; popped up on screen with a &quot;welcome to my club&quot; in a super kawaii voice and image. the streamer then quickly dropped her &quot;act&quot; of reacting to the serious drama on screen and thanked puresoy88 for subscribing... never watching live streams again smdh"
1040,"A few years down the line I hope there might be an expos√© on these bad eggs in Blizzcorp, people like these shouldn&#39;t be allowed to proliferate amongst the industry."
1041,The he/him is not a good look.
1042,I had a similar experience working at EA.
1043,I forgot hearthstone even existed üòÖ
1044,QA <del>should</del> be engineering; but it often isn&#39;t. :(
1045,Blizzard is completely fucked throwing hunger games like tasks to fire people.....
1046,"Worked more than 20 years in dev from game to bank and optics lab, I did QA as part of our dev from the start, then worked with QA teams when then became a separate science.  Yet, I don&#39;t even understand how we came to separating QA from dev, except (IMHO) from a REAL WILL to get QA out of dev in order to purposely get rid of quality constraints and reduce time and money needed to develop product with the minimum quality... or no quality at all."
1047,Stop interrupting Thor to mansplain lol
1048,Now this is the collab we all needed
1049,"My god, the number 1 rule of test (automation) is: Never get ahead of development, releases are subject to change."
1050,"This, for me, is like watching a Marvel Universe movie for the first time. Seeing some of your favorite superheroes in one video."
1051,Blizzard HR doing the work on gaslighting.
1052,"This is amazing, the new way of running things! It looks more like a wolf pack. the BOSS/alpha Protects the pack/workers! It is gonna take over, but crushing a 100-1000 y/o tradition is gonna take time!"
1053,What&#39;s up with green hair? Is this a thing? I saw it elsewhere. Can someone please explain this?
1054,I didn&#39;t know who mike was but i gathered from context
1055,"I had am hr manager ,who I reported a manager that physically threatened me to, tell me that my complaint would mean nothing because the guy had been reported before, many times. HR is useless or working for the people hurting you 100% of the time."
1056,He/Him<br><br>Gay
1057,"yep hr is always the worst. :) never trust hr, they are like the secret police of a company. haha"
1058,Jesus I thought companies I worked in were toxic but Blizzard take the biacuit
1059,I love how you can see through his hair
1060,Bozeman? gross.
1061,I had to stop listening.  Please stop interrupting a good story with useless interjections.  It&#39;s tedious.
1062,"I actually remember a story from one friend of mine, we used to work in outsourcing company together. He was a Tech Lead of 2 BE teams, and was doing great there. But his earnings weren&#39;t so good, and he was frequently communicating with management about that, but was told that actually &quot;it&#39;s bad for everyone, imagine how your subordinates feel&quot;<br><br>So he was so kinda &quot;sensitive&quot; to think about that  - he started asking on every salary promotion talk (happens once per 6 months) to just give his new bonus as a salary raise to subordinates. And it was so for 2 years<br><br>Now imagine him, eventually figuring out at some point, that not only after his giveaways his subordinates become earning more than him - they actually never earned less. It was just one big lie, cause apparently company wanted the guy to switch to management and was &quot;hinting&quot; with such moves that &quot;hey, you see, you need to go managing to earn more cause that&#39;s what we need&quot;<br><br>To say it was dissatisfying is to say nothing for sure"
1063,"In my short time in Customer Support at Blizzard (2008 to 2011) the managers never had to say things like &quot;you are all replaceable.&quot; They communicated that through their actions, which was far clearer than anything they ever said out loud."
1064,"And he still stayed there for 7 years, goes to show why these companies keep behaving like this, there&#39;s always someone available to eat their shit"
1065,"i dont know whats more suprising, this collaboration or the fact that Prime&#39;s hair is actually transparent..."
1066,"QA is integral and not treated like this in all companies, and its a shame it was treated as such in blizzard. Dont accept this as a gatekeeper of quality in your company."
1067,Charachter development
1068,"This is amazing. as an old electronics and computer engineering student who literally lost all passion about this field after seeing an article about how spotify stole the &quot;Memories&quot; format from an intern and then fired her, it really showed me the side of this industry that made me lose my passion about it in the first place. However also the back and forth between the two of you guys shines a clear light on how actually easily the better version of these enviroments are achiaveble; such as through a basic direct ticket system. <br><br>I do not regret not finishing my degree today, nor do i cherish my decision. However I know that i am after what i like, and I know that another issue this Industry faces is People Who do this job out of reasons other than being passionate about it, which in turn really degrades the &quot;Worker Quality&quot;.  &quot;Grapes go bad looking at grapes&quot;<br><br>The general outlines and thoughts however were amazing and as always in PirateSoftware fashion appliable to many other areas in life. Thank you"
1069,damn... If I ever did anything like that to the QA i work with I wouldn&#39;t have any QA left to check my stuff
1070,"Yes HR is there to protect the company. You know what protects the employees? A Union. This is why corporations work so hard to avoid forming them and why it is so important to Unionize, now more than ever. We are in an age where people at the top don&#39;t care about the people who actually do the work and they will fire them and play with them as if they were toys. For a company you are just a number."

1074,Blizzard sounds like a cult
1075,"Just say no to Blizzard! Just no, guys!"
1076,This guy sounds like a whiny and naive shitlib. ‚ÄúThe toxicity!‚Äù ‚ÄúThe sexism!‚Äù ‚ÄúThey didnt want to make special accomodations for a junior dev when there were 300 junior devs lined up that didnt need special accomodations!!!‚Äù
1077,"Blizzards QA has been really bad for years, its clear they&#39;re ruining peoples lives."
1078,"Its not a problem only at blizzard but an attitude allot of companies in the gaming industry have tough: working at gaming company is fun, so people dont need to earn as much as a for eaxample a grocery bagger since this is not fun. Was working as 3D artist in a gaming company for some time, the lady cleaning the office had a higher loan/h compared to the avarage artist that invested years of time and money into studying. If people are willing to do it, thats what happens. Isnt captitalism a great concept?"
1079,When you two ever get sick of streaming please make a podcast where you talk with guests about this sort of thing. Could listen for hours and so good insights.
1080,"Blizzard being bad i knew, them being so shit that working at fucking amazon looks like a blessing in comparison, though..."
1081,&gt;that billings story<br>sounds about right
1082,And while listening to all this... remember that bobby cottondick is literally rich af üòÖ
1083,Some people at blizzard has too much time to put these mental games together just to fire people
1084,Average view duration on the yt stream was 1337<br><br>Nice
1085,"I sent a letter to Blizzard when I was a kid. I was told that they couldn&#39;t take game ideas, yet they didn&#39;t return my letter. Most of my game ideas ended up in Diablo 2, World of Warcraft, and especially Heros of the Storm."
1086,"I am only about give minutes into this video and wondering, half way house?  Where was his family at?  Why isn&#39;t his dad involved in all this crisis with QA teams?"
1087,i swear i watched this video months ago... but now it says it was posted 6 days ago
1088,"If you two collaborated more, once you guys know each other&#39;s conversational pacing more intuitively, this could be one of the greatest developer content duos of all time. OF ALL TIME."
1089,"Musical chairs, but for your job."
1090,"Unfortunately this happens in the non-gaming sector of IT as well. Middle managers need to have a reason to exist so they make all of our lives hell to validate their role. Extra rules that make no sense, taking the credit for our successes and throwing their own mistakes and the blame for them on us. Sad to hear that blizzard is like this too, but I kinda figured. If the toxicity of the devs leaks out to the players I imagine its far worse in house."
1091,"If people are unsure who HR is there for, just listen to the fucking name of the time. Human Resources. You&#39;re a resource. Who happens to be a human."
1092,"Just one thing worth pointing out, if you have employment based VISA such as an H1B, you generally have 60 days to find new employment before having to leave the country. It&#39;s not like ICE is picking you up at the gates of the company and taking you to the airport. Now, granted, that&#39;s still a pretty damn short time and puts people in a very bad spot, just wanted accurate information to be added to this."
1093,"This was a very interesting video, not surprising about the endless HR BS and horrible workload as well as work environment. I also did want to work for them when WoW was still young but this has now long passed for me.<br>The talk about the fog of war in HoTS and Starcraft 2 was interesting as well, I always though that it was a server service, now it makes scence that the online gaming part goes to shit when someone is either lagging like crazy or DCing.<br>Makes me sad to hear shit like this!"
1094,"Well after listening to this, No Fucking Wonder most games suck these days. Indie market is the future. This is Valuable insight and nothing but praise for bringing this to light."
1095,"90s Blizzard, IDSoftware and Epic Megagames were the three companies i really wanted to work for as a kid, I learned 3D... as I graduated, realized, the companies i looked up to, were really bad and it was only great when it was the core people involved and had a smaller backing and smaller team."
1096,"This good mindset is what the small RPG company MCDM has. They pay everyone very well and value everyone&#39;s job equally and they just broke records with over $4 million via Backerkit for their own  RPG. Their 5e books have been hitting $2 million plus in backing. They are doing things right, being ethical and putting out superior products. Like he said. This attitude makes it hard to fail."
1097,Blizzard was the Disney of Gaming and now they have become the Disney of Gaming...
1098,It&#39;s woerd because you feel bad about this firings at blizzard yet from what is being described it should be cause for celebrations for the people getting fired
1099,"the only two guys i watch long format videos of together in one! and I&#39;ll be clear, i usually am too damned busy for long videos but you both somehow tweak my adhd into doing it.  great vid please make more!"
1100,"Too much talking at the same time, great topic but pretty bad chemistry."
1101,"Aside from the borderline illegal conditions and practices, the QA story explains why gaming budgets are out of control. If you strip away the celebrities, marketing, and extra add ons, this is why games cost so much to develop."
1102,Learning about HR&#39;s role? I just felt somebody&#39;s class consciousness grow. Love it!
1103,I didn‚Äôt know Howard Stern got his start at Blizzard in the 90s.  Multidimensional man!
1104,80 20 rule.  80 percent of the work in a company is done by 20 percent of the people. the other 80 percent of people are worthless at best and working counter to the companies interest at worst.
1105,"American companies thinking that whatever they put in contract is binding, lol. The sheer arrogance and ignorance from being unrestricted for so long. Any part of contract in my country, an EU member, that is illegal can be safely ignored, or voids the entire contract altogether. It can also be grounds for lawsuit from your side, I am sure."
1106,Holy shit that &quot;Critical Task&quot; thing is a Michael Scott-level bad idea.
1107,"The comment about the damage of having a bad manager is also in the damage caused figuring out how bad they are. You don‚Äôt recognize you are losing the game until you‚Äôve lost in that scenario, rough af."
1108,"There are no good hr people. Even if it turns out that they happen to be a good person, then that would make them a very naive and dangerous person. Hitler was a person, too, rapist are people too, killers and murderers are people too, but that doesn&#39;t matter. When at the end of the day, their actions amount to something terrible. HR people threw away their humanity to become a tool for someone else. They don&#39;t exist, &amp; they died from my perspective. Until they find their humanity again , which means they would act on it , they don&#39;t deserve sympathy."
1109,"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KGQSTDm5ois&amp;t=1812"">30:12</a> Wow that&#39;s like an internal Stack Overflow sort of thing, awesome"
1110,"I worked retail for about 5 years before I got kidney failure and couldn&#39;t work anymore.. and I was forced to quit.. and I can confirm that the leaders and HR, they do not give a shit about you. Before that I worked at a hardware store for 8 years, and found out that I as a full time had less per hour than a part time guy that was retired, but wanted to work a little. Went straight to the boss and said that I wanted more because I was managing orders and did most of the heavy lifting because I was young and strong at that time and could handle stress even with chronic bowel disease, he said no and showed me a table and tried to bullshit me on how many years I had been working.

1114,wtf!!! why would anyone accept a job at a premier game developer for $10 an hour?? that&#39;s completely insane.
1115,back then 10 n hour was actually very good...12 n hour was good too and grocery baggers back in the day used to make enough to buy a house and have a family...money had way more purchasing power back than...today we have massive inflation which kills that so 10 n hour back then is like 30 n hour today...<br><br>back then in so ca 30 n hour was affordable and i know this cuz i was making 10 n hour working for a electrical contractor delivering parts to the job sites....i was able to buy a studio apartment and a car and go to college all on 10 n hour...paid weekly...yes the world was very different way back then
1116,"We use the term Line Manager in our company for any manager, supervisor or lead that has the authority to give access or permissions to applications within that team.

1125,"The problem with the email mike system is that someone could use it to paint someone who did nothing wrong in a bad light and it&#39;s sad, but true. Especially if the target is a single person and you got a group behind you. It&#39;s sad, but that is how it goes. It&#39;s not full proof cause without living in that group you can&#39;t truly know. As in companies I worked for this happened where you get someone to investigate and they hide whats going on and then they turn the tables on you as you are the problem. As most people in these higher positions don&#39;t understand what the job is and they can&#39;t watch something that clearly shows a day to day struggle with the job. When I worked at wendy&#39;s my district manager didn&#39;t even know how to make most things on the menu. It&#39;s sad, but this can happen especially in buisinesses that have been around longer then the founder could still be alive. As those good values existed, but once the next person takes over all gone and more often then not the original ceo didn&#39;t have these values in the first place. I have had things like this happened to me at Masonite and as a unpaid tester for Predecessor. As I&#39;m very vocal about my opinions and I don&#39;t like to hide myself. As the team for Pred, Omeda Studios had propogated a culture of making their testers scared of retaliation where most people were worried about that. I was blunt and honest and meticulous. I would record whole play sessions and scour the whole thing for bugs and if I notice something I would rewatch it multiple times to make sure there was something wrong. Where most testers were asked to use the feature of record the last 30 seconds if the noticed a bug in game. I got into it with them a few times about serious bugs. Like about melee hit detection where I would get audio queues and the opponent was in range, but it did nothing. It would be like 7 basic attacks in a row and nothing. They would say it was ping. Even though for 100 ping that is severe. They got footage from another moba to show me that this is how it works and the footage they got proved them wrong. As is showed delayed damage for all autos that hit and the distance of the opponent was greater with a much higher ping and the enemy character had an ability that would block basics that show no damage. Where they acted like those were missed basics when you can see the animation for the block go off when it did no damage. We had a few other falling outs about problems. Until eventually in a group chat outside of the discord I disagreed with them on how a character should work and they were saying it was a bug, but it was only a bug because a developer said it was so. If the dev said it wasn&#39;t and it was intended they would agree with them. Then what I said to them it&#39;s because the dev said one way or another and I wasn&#39;t getting a true opinion it made me frustrated. So I listed off other character changes I hated from the original Paragon and ended up having to go to work and at work I got notified of my removal from the testing team. I had a few people tell me how it happened wasn&#39;t ok from the team and one guy I barely talked too asking why I was removed and telling me what they said in my absence. They said I have been warned multiple times and I was making the place toxic. As I only ever got one warning and that warning was after I said. I didn&#39;t want to play a character after it got nerfed and I was warned not to say that and that I would lose my privilege to test. So I said sorry and never did it again. On top of this the person who reached out to me. Said it seemed like I made things fun in the environment said It seemed like everyone had a great time and they were other much more toxic people that didn&#39;t. Sadly two of these people were joining the development team and were a part of that outside group and they really didn&#39;t like me. So I was unceromoniously removed and slandered and I have been traumatized since. Where social interactions feel very fake to me and it&#39;s hard to trust people at all. There is much more to this story, but not something I can cover in a youtube comment, but I still very much struggle with social interactions, where before I started taking parts in these jobs. I was very outgoing and could chit chat with most people. Now it feels like the only friend I really have is my wife."

1149,Mmmmmaaaannn! I worked a awesome marketing corporate job when I was 21. This video gave me ptsd. It‚Äôs started off as a mom and pop in a way. Then slowly went corporate. Don‚Äôt get me wrong it had its pros but man did it have its cons. It was so hard to describe to family and friends how bad it got. Corporate will fuck you up. Every example they used I experienced. I remember once watching my boss get pulled into a glass room and get tore up where the entire office watched her crying publicly. I remember one accountant who noticed that the company was going corporate corporate and he immediately quit. He was warning us to do the same. We laughed at the look of fear in his eyes. Flash forward 7 years later. I was part of the last of crew of the starting 80. Man did we see some ish. They had me relocated to a different state. No family or friends. Then promised to promote me to a lead position. Fired my old crew. Then made me single handedly do all the franchisee work and designer corporate work. By myself for an entire year. Then would attack me if anything went wrong. I was told I‚Äôll be put out to pasture. I was at a constant state of anxiety and fear for my job security. With nothing not even a supporting staff to pass on tasks too. Bombarded with daily meetings that ended in rush projects with 2 hour deadlines. While in a chokehold by a 2 year relocation contract that would charge me thousands if I quit. The only cure was drinking heavily. I work a small shitty job now that barely pays but I‚Äôm relieved. I can breathe again. I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôll ever want to work for a corporation again. Only if it‚Äôs a good one. To me that‚Äôs rare to find these days. Especially since everyone is speaking up now at least people know in advance now. Great video

It brings nothing to have a separate team to &quot;test&quot; stuff, instead of having the dev team themselves also be Q&amp;A at the same time. It might slow down the process but it would ensure the people making the game actually knowing the game intimately, forcing them to psychologically invest more into the game since they have to also play at as a job. At least that is how I will structure my company in the future, also having a shift system where everyone has to be pretty much Q&amp;A inside a cycle from dev to testing and back. Personally if you are going to be developing a game, you should at least be able to play the game well enough since you actually played the game that you made. We sail together, we sink together should be the motto of creative teams."

The sad reality, is that in most of the english speaking world HAVING skills or talent these days locks you into a position. Companies will not promote you because they&#39;d lose efficiency if they did - which would make their numbers look worse to their boss and so on.  And without those official title promotions, it&#39;s hard to move on to a new company in a higher position because of lack of experience that you can show. bullshit like 1-2% raises every year or few and an obsession with capturing people who have a passion for the product and making them work for slave wages because it&#39;s their &#39;dream job&#39; when they could actually be making significantly more living in a small town flipping burgers is ridiculous and way too common in the tech world now.<br><br>I&#39;ve ALWAYS loved computers, I had an uncle that was a tech in the 90s and gave our family a pretty sweet setup. by the time I was 7 I was all too familiar with taking apart and putting together a computer, beginning to understand diagnostics and was quite proficient on the software side being able to navigate through formatting, Unbricking windows via regedits which I had to do way too much and starting to become familiar with Hamachi servers and networking in general. I ended up in a group of greyhat hackers as an early teen and learned quite a bit of python, HTML injection, C++, Java and anything else I could pick up and ended up with a rather well-implemented at the time Botnet embedded in Kaspersky (Trust me, the Irony there is NOT lost on me all these years later). I never deployed it to outside parties, it was more-so just an experiment of what was possible using mine and my buddies computers.<br><br>I ended up going to school, doing all that jazz and getting a job that actually paid significantly worse than the job I quit it for - Sitting on a forklift for 8 hours at a hardware store and hanging out with people the whole time. Almost everyone I knew has left the industry, either going to the hardware engineering side or like in my case joining a trade and doing &quot;Terrible back breaking work&quot; (If I have to lift something heavy I can use a crane) for a wage that would look absolutely ridiculous compared on a bar graph, The kids in highschool that dropped out unironically are some of the only people I know that own houses, multiple paid off vehicles, frequent vacations and the whole 9. And lots of them had acquired this by the time they were in their mid 20&#39;s.

1186,This hit home hard. I worked at EA in Burnaby Canada as QA under VOLT&#39;s Canadian subsidiary on FIFA right after I graduated and life was pretty tough paying for student loans and life in general but I had friends there and I thought I was just doing what you had to. The day it changed for me though was the day I walked in and saw a breakfast buffet table laid out &gt;15ft from my desk for the celebration for the launch of FIFA17. I got visibly excited because normally the best I could afford was one the pathetic but edible egg burritos from the cafeteria downstairs for $3. I was regularly starving myself to survive and this buffet table looked like mana from heaven. Then one on my teammates with a very sour face stuck his head out and stopped me from grabbing any food with a &quot;You better check your email first.&quot; Confused I did just that only to be met with an email that stated that all contractors(90% of the QA hired by EA at the time) were not allowed to take part in any of the celebratory festivities since the company couldn&#39;t(wouldn&#39;t) pay for all the small teams to do the same. So there I sat running over in my head how little sense it made to do this to a team of Security QA who had access to the most up to date knowledge of how people exploited their flagship game.(casino for the stupid) We then were forced to sit through the celebrations happening for all the other devs in the room who were treated to 2 meals that day and had one raffle for 3-5 things every hour for prized like iPads and $200 gift cards. I can&#39;t speak for my team but I felt like a second class citizen at my own job. These days I have found myself out of work and back in with my parents while I seek help for my mental health since I basically had a mental breakdown a little over a year ago. I moved from Vancouver due to the high cost of living and some other issues in the industry to a promising town only to watch the industry in that town(Calgary) die out after a bad switch in government in the province. I often wonder how much my life would have been different if I had got the raise from EA when I asked for the $2 raise that was denied for a 20c one. If I hadn&#39;t burned out from starving even while living with 3 other people. Maybe I could be doing the Narrative design work I wanted to work on but never had the energy to start on the side. I love games and they have pulled me through many hard times but trying to make them has also almost killed me now and have left me lost and broken. I survived those dark days due to some amazing friends and a loving family but I know not everyone is that lucky. Thank you to everyone here both in the video and in the comments for sharing their stories so we can get the word out about these practices. Maybe one day this industry won&#39;t be such a mess for those that follow us.

1195,"Productivity managers fire people for being meticulous all the time, unfortunately."
1196,"They weren&#39;t fired for being meticulous, they were fired for not following directions. There were many brain teasers in grade school about following directions that followed this concept. &quot;here&#39;s a 30 step process, step 1 is to read every other step before you begin. step 2-28 are random tasks. Step 30 says that only step 1, 29 and 30 are valid, all others are to be ignored. Step 30 is to leave the room&quot;. So if you started performing any of the tasks of 2-28, then it means you did not follow the VERY FIRST STEP which would have told you not to do any of the tasks from step 2-28. <br><br>In a real world situation, not following the very first step can very well cause issues down the line because no process can be perfectly worded, and step-by-step instructions are critical for getting as near to universal comprehension as possible. You have to start a step-by-step process from step 1, that&#39;s common sense, otherwise you may be doing every other step wrong. That being said, Blizzard should not have fired people simply for failing, rather examined WHY they failed. Maybe they were overworked, under paid, under trained. There&#39;s potentially a dozen or more reasons why a process may fail, and to simply dismiss the employees without any self awareness on the company&#39;s part is disgusting, inhumane, moronic and self destructive. Hopefully they at least had some kind of conversation with the employees to learn more about why they failed, and to give them some chance at redemption, but knowing Blizzard that is pretty unlikely."

He&#39;d also be entitled to garden leave in this instance. It&#39;s a fairly common occurence for American companies to try and hold UK workers to American style contracts and they routinely get rebuffed, though it does take the employee actually taking it to a tribunal so who knows how often they get away with it."

1202,"@<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KGQSTDm5ois&amp;t=1110"">18:30</a> - That is very much a case of the boss making the difference, not amazon.  Bezo&#39;s told everyone that you can &quot;work harder, smarter, or longer. Pick two of the three.&quot;  Most of places in Amazon, for white collar jobs (not talking about warehouses), do not give a shit about your burn out and are very much about your levels and looking down on folks who are below them.  They do give the lip service to &#39;work life balance&#39; but it is same bs it is everywhere in tech. If you actually use all of your vacation you will be left behind at best, and likely eventually fired."
1203,Makes so much sense that Q&amp;A was the first thing to get cut as a company standard when you look at the state of games being released over the last 10 years.
1204,"An important thing to clarify is if his title was changed in the system or if he was just given the added responsibilities. If they truly did not change anything, there is a chance the non compete would not be enforceable since they are still labeled as a regular employee."
1205,"I recently found a job that pays 2.25x what my current job is, and is less work overall. In order to absolutely ace the cover letter and interview, I started doing my research into who currently works there, from the CEO to the people who I&#39;d be working alongside. I discovered they have a massive amount of churn, and they&#39;re policed as to when they clock in and out (which is especially irritating as my job is task-based, and doesn&#39;t make sense for me to stay at work if there&#39;s no work). The actual management staff are the ones who are anonymously posting on places like Glassdoor, and they all talk about it like Thor talks about Blizzard.<br><br>So here I am still."
1206,Hasbro is in the process of doing what Microsoft did to Blizzard... ironic or maybe not... the c suite at hasbro is old microsoft execs... go figure.
1207,"Same stuff that happened to Sayers happened to one of my friends, was basically told &quot;hey if you do all of this extra work that isn&#39;t part of your job you&#39;ll get a promotion in x time&quot; and when x time came the manager acted like he didn&#39;t know what he was on about. He now puts in the bare minimum to maintain his job."
1208,I have a hard time feeling bad for devs that put pronouns in their Twitter profile. They caved to corporate pressure as a group and it came down on them. Now they just live like that. It&#39;s sad. They could be so much more.
1209,"Yeah the reason you work at these companies, legacy game developers, is for the legacy, because you buy into the legacy, and want to perpetuate, but you soon learn very few who stay or get up the ladder care for the legacy, just about cutting costs to increase the profit margin, and they will do anything to make it look like they are responsible for that profit increase, when it&#39;s more likely to happen DESPITE their actions or inactions.<br><br>Anyone who continued to care for the legacy, and are ABLE to, leave, so they are not part of the system destroying that legacy, for quick profit, they go to companies, organisations, that value them and their labour, so that they can build in inspiration from the legacy they had wished to help grow, they can&#39;t help that legacy they loved, but they can continue it in spirit, and those who also value that legacy will see this, and buy into their work.<br><br>It&#39;s why, I think, that so many genres that have died off in AA and AAA game creation, have sprung up, like boomer shooters, and strategy games like C&amp;C, or civilisation, there&#39;s something people have noticed even if they can&#39;t give words to, that these genres are lacking, and so they are trying to recreate these legacy games and genres.<br><br>Sure there&#39;s copycats and rip-offs, but that&#39;s true no matter what, it&#39;s like piracy, it&#39;s always gonna exist, it&#39;s out of Pandora&#39;s Box, it&#39;s not possible to put it back, to undo that change."
1210,"Every time I hear more about Mike Morhaime, the more respect I have for him."
1211,WTF is he talking about?! What talent? Blizzard has not had talented devs since the end of Pandaria not to mention they fired the whole Blizzard North studio! I get that Pirate was there for a long time but that doesn&#39;t mean he&#39;s good. Also if he worked there for 10+ years then it means he&#39;s one of the people responsible for developing Warlords of Draenor and that was the beginning of the end for WoW alone.
1212,Question: would Chris be violating a non-compete if he wasn&#39;t a lead in his new position?
1213,"OMG, I hate the fake sympathy so so much. When calling for support from any company, they would be like, oh, I feel so bad for you. Internally, I&#39;m thinking &quot;b*, I am just a number to you so skip all the &quot;sympathy&quot; stuff and get to the point. Cuz neither of us believe what you&#39;re saying.&quot;"
1214,Why no links to Thor in the description??
1215,"Being an Ex-Blizzard employee from the customer service side, hearing this hit&#39;s home.  So many things that happened in Cali happened in the Texas location too."
1216,"Unpopular opinion, but as someone who spent a decade+ in QA and is now in dev, I think QA is a band aid for rushed schedules and budget constraints.  The other thing that I didn&#39;t expect is you get better code when you develop without QA.  This is counterintutive but the reason is that developers are held 100% responsible for any bug that goes out into production and there is no deflection or conversation about why something was &quot;missed&quot; in testing."
1217,"Non competes aren&#39;t really enforceable by the way, so good luck to them. But yes, talk to a lawyer."
1218,I worked QA at THQ several years before it went under. Much better experience there but yes you get tread on a lot
1219,"There are two ways to solve this, to ensure the best conditions to the economy.<br><br>right libertarian:<br>1. make easy to fire people <br>2. get an unemployment insurance <br><br>left libertarian: avoid a vertical company, start a cooperative."
1220,"‚ÄúStill got the name but don‚Äôt got the game‚Äù. Sadly, a pretty good description for aging‚Ä¶"
1221,I dont know how big Bozeman is. But i swear there was this amazing physics professor that would do youtube videos called Bozeman Science.<br><br>Place just breads good youtubers I guess
1222,"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KGQSTDm5ois&amp;t=1662"">27:42</a> I Love it!"
1223,"noncompetes are illegal in most countries, if they tell me that I will laugh so hard in their face, get a lawyer and sue them."
1224,"QA are treated like test monkeys only removed from the general public by a pay check, one that they should be thankful for, not enough?  How dare you! They are not part of the cool dev team actually making the game.  That is the feeling/comments I got from the few times ive listened to people talk about their QA team on a number of project&#39;s"
1225,"Wow.... both of these experiences, Thor&#39;s, and Chris&#39;... are shocking.  I didn&#39;t think Blizzard could disappoint me any more, but they (management) seem to keep raising the bar for being shitty."
1226,"I have worked as a QA/Software Tester for close to 15 years now.  I have just as many horror stories and experiences.  The thing that stood out to me the most was Thor discussing embedded QA.  The few times I&#39;ve worked in proper embedded QA, it has produced the best products with the most efficiency.  I also worked at Amazon Game Studios in QA and LOVED it until AGS layoffs cut a lot of the experimental projects out."
1227,I really appreciate that Thor named his personal console bridge the Bifrost
1228,"Damn, I love it when my chocolate üç´ gets into my peanut ü•ú butter."
1229,Mike Morhaime is a beast.
1230,1) NEVER take on more work without a signed contract unless you are ok without compensation.<br>2) Non competes are fucking worthless.  Call their bluff next time.
1231,"Original Blizzard was toxic af, literal slave labor, current blizzard escalated to sexual assault, r*pe and making people commit suicide, it‚Äôs what I imagine the christian church descripts as hell."
1232,Turding Point? ü§°

1236,"Always happy to chat.<br>Keep kicking ass, dude!"
1237,"Take a page from the Emperors of old, Pay a few employees another salary and they report directly to you or a small team you trust. Have them report any problems that reduce morale, efficiency, and useless overhead. Send an unbiased(multiple members) audit team to check it out. Become a dictator, and rule the world."
1238,&quot;I can see you&#39;re frustrated&quot; is the HR equivalent of &quot;Thoughts and prayers&quot;
1239,I love how blizzard loves to preach at their players about being a toxic playerbase while being completely and utterly toxic.
1240,"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KGQSTDm5ois&amp;t=1135"">18:55</a> &quot;you were so overworked at blizzard, that you don&#39;t know what it&#39;s like to work a normal job.&quot; Holy crap, dude."
1241,"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KGQSTDm5ois&amp;t=280"">4:40</a> And still not the sharpest tool in the shed. Most people prefer 1st shift, so 2nd pays a bit more, and overnight possibly even more than that. Yikes."
1242,"the &quot;abandon hope&quot; thing is actualy in the entrance to heaven, not hell!"
1243,Bro has  he/him in his name hahaha  and we wonder why gaming is so gay now a days
1244,microsoft is also a game studio and if they could recognized build and develop game develop teams/talent they wouldnt need to go around throwing their money at legacy games of dead companies just to have IPs they would just develop their own like Nintendo and sony. was so obvious microsoft buying blizzard was not going to be it redemption story its the old yeller story.
1245,blizzard is evil
1246,"Pausing the conversation for ads happening in your own real-time stream experience is dystopian and weird AF.  Obviously this convo is interesting enough for me to stick around for all of it, but as someone who never watches live streams, it‚Äôs bizarre."
1247,Hey the good news is we are now (the gamer) the monkey with KB ... and we PAY to do it :D the client is the QA
1248,"let the smart guy talk more, interrupting so much bro!"
1249,These two people weren&#39;t the same people?
1250,"Location based pay is bullshit, you&#39;re hired for skills and abilities, not your address."
1251,"These stories are completely parallel with other industries. Lateral promotions, false promises, extra work, and no financial compensation... Cliques... Ugh. I left my last job for these exact reasons. I worked in electrical engineering for govt contracting company. (So the company was the contractor not us)"
1252,"QA getting ahead is called &quot;Planning&quot;.<br>So, we see which Team was to get the Heat because they fucked up - Project Management.<br>The &quot;Badge Thing&quot; is a cause of that as well - because it comes from the hard NDAs that are demanded that prevent the Branches of development not communicate properly - they are literally not allowed to do so while a proper Project Development demands it via the nature of the Process.<br>This again goes down to Management fucking up - the Shit that fell down should had and has to fall up to the Process to work properly and has to be communicated properly to not get Tocic rather than to be a &quot;fertile Ground to grow on&quot;.<br>That is what &quot;Management&quot; is about.<br><br>So, that are the People making the Mistakes, which acted &quot;imcapable of doing their Jobs properly."
1253,"It&#39;s so crazy that this shit is STILL going on. The mindset of undervaluing QA is still very pervasive in the biz. You&#39;d think that they&#39;d learn over time, but no."
1254,Good job.
1255,Enjoy your Netflix. lol
1256,"We have a summer house on an island. My grandmother, who owned the summer house, was getting very old, and she wanted a one story little house for herself and my grandfather, so they picked a spot, out on a rocky outcropping, and had it built. Everything was fine, until one summer they arrived and within a day noticed something wrong. The walls would... writhe, and, concerned, they asked the family for help. They tore down the walls and ants fell out. Hundreds of thousands of ants. They had inadvertently built on an anthill. They stomped ants, shoveled them into garbage bags and burned them. The entire house had to be torn down. Moral of my story: if you&#39;re going to build a house, check for ants. Over and over and over."
1257,There is a big difference between a QA Tester and a QA Engineer. I&#39;ll always take the engineer
1258,"Sounds really damn horrific man holy hell. That this kind of exploitation is the norm is wild to me. The company squeezed everything they could from that worker and it&#39;s apparently the norm. It really does make me sick, no person deserves getting treated like that, he&#39;s clearly a good person drained for all he was worth. I hope Chris Sayers gets the opportunity to heal from that kind of betrayal because the man was betrayed and lied to. I really wish him all the best wherever he goes."
1259,"This was a great interview but my alarm bells really went off at @<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KGQSTDm5ois&amp;t=1970"">32:50</a> where they are talking about being able to do maphacks because all unit locations of the entire map are on the client in starcraft/hots<br><br>This is FUNDEMENTALLY necessary for a completely deterministic lockstep simulation like starcraft and hots, the fact that Pirate software is trying to make this sound like a totally solvable problem is blowing my mind"
1260,riblizzard dude
1261,Thor: &quot;enjoy your netflix&quot;<br>Agen: &quot;will do&quot;<br><br>lmao
1262,"Once I saw Thor on the thumbnail, I knew I had to click on this video."
1263,I love how these non-compete contracts are heavily protected by law in my country. It&#39;s like 40% pay if the time is less than 4months and 60% if 4months or longer.
1264,"My takeaway from the video is, never work for a game development company."
1265,YouTube is literally deleting any comment I make critical of Blizzard. It&#39;s really gross.
1266,"HR is there to protect the company from it&#39;s employee, but when there is a union, force opposite to the HR, on the horizon, 99% of companies go &quot;save our employees from big bad union&quot;"
1267,cant take a guy with blue hair serious ...
1268,Used to Work QA at Activision back in 2003 - 2006 and this was par for the course.<br>It was one of my first jobs ever. It was always a dream of mine to work in QA for Activision.  I had always been a life long avid gamer. <br>After I left the industry at the end of 2006 (after a short stint at EA) I didnt TOUCH a video game for at least 5 years.<br><br>They treated us like dirt.
1269,"I was part of one of the last &quot;layoff waves&quot; that happened across the tech industry and I feel SOOO lucky to have been in the UK side of the company when it happened. We had a 30 days paid period to look for alternative positions within and outside the company and a settlement package just by law + whatever the company wanted to add to that.<br>Our US colleagues got to work one morning and within the hour they were removed from all systems without enough time to even say bye to the rest of the team. There are some pretty terrifying stories about some colleagues is pretty dire situations when this happened like a woman 8 months pregnant only a few days away from going into maternity leave and now she was suddenly without a job, without maternity pay, etc...<br>Really shocking how work law really lets down the employees in the US."
1270,ALWAYS send a &quot;just to confirm the content of our earlier conversation&quot; email after having conversations at work about work things.<br><br>It&#39;s also amazing how often sending that email lights a fire under people&#39;s ass. Suddenly they know they are not going to slide shit past you.
1271,When I see pronouns in their bio I know they got that victimhood mentality. Credibility is automatically questionable.
1272,"Came for the Blizzard drama, stayed for the Goblin King lol"
1273,"I dont understand why company implementthe  badge color discrimination. I used to work for Cisco and contractors wore red border badge and full-timer wore green. <br>not sure they still do, but it definitely makes you feel &quot;different&quot;"
1274,QA keeps dev in check
1275,now imagine what its like working at EA
1276,and now fem boys and cat girls work at blizzard
1277,it just blows my mind how bad some people are in management. i cant even comprehend how some of these people live their lives.
1278,My two favorite influencers together üòç
1279,Yoo asmon i see you stealing content again
1280,"Quick input on leadership being a &quot;lateral move&quot; (especially in regard to pay): For the <b>*vast majority*</b> of companies, Senior Engineers/Developers make more than Engineering Managers. However, Lead Engineers generally make more than Senior Engineers. Companies can and will abuse this with ambiguous responsibilities vs. title analogues."
1281,alot he says is not legal by uk law so the 3 month cant be binding
1282,No one can say Blizzard isn&#39;t consistent; they treat their employees with as much respect as they treat their customers.
1283,"Yet they make more and more profit, and the CEO does less but gets more. Got to love the ruling class"
1284,What I really wanna know is how come the top YouTube comment is not the name: the Pirateagen
1285,one IT company i worked in had two seperat departments doing IT for two different areas that had nothing to do with each other.<br>and so the QA was done by first testing it inside the own department then sending it from one department to the other department where it got tested and send back.<br>and as a guideline we had 1h programming means 1 hour testing in deparment and 2 hours testing in the other department ...<br>so on 1 hour coding was 3 hours testing and quality ensurance ... <br>it was a big company making million dollar deals with customers for enterprise systems and there was just no room for errors so the QA was 3 times as importent as the coding but done in the end by the same people.<br>And yes of course the departments did let the &quot;younger&quot; and newer people test it so the developers who were there for a long time had time to code but when there was someone needed they did it as well.<br>you cant make QA a side effort
1286,"So back then QA was treated like shit. Then companies learned that they could just not do QA, and release in &quot;Early Access&quot;. XD"
1287,"People don&#39;t understand that non competes are largely unenforceable. There&#39;s situations for it, but you can&#39;t prevent someone from earning a wage *at all*. Get a lawyer..."
1288,lol this grifter didn&#39;t even know who mike was
1289,"Glad I got this take from you at <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KGQSTDm5ois&amp;t=1628"">27:08</a> I suppose I should do that too."
1290,"I worked at Intel briefly and and at the time they had the same color badge crap.  Blue was intel employees, green was contractors.  The two sides didn&#39;t mix together."
1291,"I was a QA for the Mosaic web browser at Spyglass in Champaign IL in the early days of the internet. I was good at understanding and breaking stuff, but more importantly really good at explaining how to reproduce it. Microsoft bought components from Spyglass that were used to build Internet Explorer (acknowledged at the very bottom of the About text if you ever scrolled that far) before HTTP and HTML rendering were common knowledge. Then, Microsoft included IE in Windows to destroy Netscape amongst other things I won&#39;t get into. Killed Spyglass&#39; component business model which wasn&#39;t sustainable of course. Was a great internship and brief job. Never forgot Microsoft&#39;s tactics. Keep that in mind with AI, young ones. Open Source AI is the only way to keep power in the hands of the people... Zuck, I believe, is just trying to undermine Microsoft&#39;s lead, not necessarily help us. Everyone wants to be Ricky Bobby. Nobody wants to BE Ricky Bobby. Don&#39;t know where I&#39;m going with that. File a joke bug report. Just an opinion. Condolences to the folks being treated like garbage."
1292,"So basically, its a moral imperative to NOT give blizzard your money. Easy"
1293,He/him cringe af
1294,"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KGQSTDm5ois&amp;t=2260"">37:40</a> prime: &quot;That mike fella sounds like he didn&#39;t SUBSCRIBE to that kind of model&quot;<br>youtube subscribe button: Oh hey there guess imma be lighting up for a moment"

1296,A guys voice shouldn‚Äôt sound this good. Damit now I have to subscribe‚Ä¶.
1297,"I work as a dev in AAA and I work with QA all the time. I always treat them with respect and understand we all have different skills/needs and they are an important defense against us publishing bad code, but this helps me see that sometimes others don&#39;t see QA that way."
1298,"QA can sort of get ahead of development by reviewing feature requirements/specs/documentation for near future features, and raise any issues that arise from that. But yeah, QA shouldn&#39;t be testing things that are not ready."
1299,Hardly anybody from HR is a human being.
1300,Favorite collab ever
1301,This guy sounds like someone I&#39;d want to be friends with.
1302,Please give us more of this collab
1303,i just read the response posted and im like what the actual fuck is this. the last 2 people got fired and your &quot;compensation&quot; was losing 50 cents... ive had my fair share of shitty jobs but never have i seen something that bad. ive never been &quot;promoted&quot; to a worse pay
1304,It doesn&#39;t matter what the company is called anymore. They all treat you the same.
1305,"Something I&#39;m running into at work currently is the whole &quot;QA v Dev&quot; situation.<br>I have an embedded QA team work with me, and they&#39;re amazing. Love them, they do great work, we would have nowhere as good of a product as we do without them.<br><br>We are looking into a &quot;Software Dev Engineer in Testing (SDET)&quot; role. It&#39;s about automating testing, engineering all the stuff PirateSoftware is talking about what he did. Very technical, all about writing code, putting full end-to-end suites of coverage tests/integration tests/etc.<br><br>So I guess I have is this: Does a QA position <b>have</b> to be an SDET, or is there a spot for less intense QA spots that just manually run the tests as a user? Is there a difference? Should there be a difference? My QA team isn&#39;t SDETs, and I still could never see us doing as well as we are without them, and I don&#39;t think they need to change what they do. <br><br>So, with that in mind - does every QA have to be an engineer? I think sometimes having a non-engineer perspective is crucial, so very important."
1306,I love it when I find a couple of my parasocials chillin&#39; together.
1307,Palo Alto-South Palo Alto also... same as Oaktown. Lot of life lessons I also painfully lived through
1308,"I don&#39;t know about game development, QA may be different in that world, but in my professional opinion, if you have ACs that are written to be understood and tested by QEs, then you have clear direction for developers, and the QA will be more efficient. Good QEs are rockstars, because they find holes that the devs miss."
1309,it&#39;s clearly genThorMan
1310,I recall being fired for trying to focus on quality in a dysfunctional store...<br>Had other employees admit they didn&#39;t focus on quality and just did numbers. <br>I don&#39;t know how there wouldn&#39;t be a special box in the universe for those types of managers to suffer in...
1311,Slave Labour.
1312,"When HR doesn‚Äôt get rid of the problem managers, they are not protecting the company, they are failing at their job.<br>When HR get‚Äôs rid of a victim of a bad manager, they are protecting the company but they should also follow up with fixing the root of the problem because it will impact performance in the short and long term as well as eventually turn into a lawsuit."
1313,Blizzard went from GOAT game studio to GOAT awful working conditions üëèüëèüëè<br> <br>TO not be content and go for another title? üëè Winners mentality on display üëè
1314,"SOLID interview. Very important reflections and insights!<br>The AAA, and now rumored AAA-A game developers, with ten thousand employees, is not sustainable at all. Maybe the Blizzard name losing its weight might be a good thing. People won&#39;t work there for nothing and be treated like shit just because"
1315,"So the USA sucks in that my country pays you double the hourly rate , if you work nights."
1316,In Europe non compete clauses are illegal (i.e unenforceable) if they don‚Äôt come with appropriate financial compensation.
1317,"The problem is that it‚Äôs really hard to evaluate a manager‚Äôs performance without day to day contact with them. And even more so when recruiting them.<br>Lots of bad managers get to keep their jobs for decades even though they do not act in the interest of the company and make everyone under them miserable. When they are eventually pushed out, they find a similar position right away because they can leverage their extensive ‚Äúexperience‚Äù on paper and the people hiring will never know how bad they were at their previous job.<br>In short manager‚Äôs carriers don‚Äôt depend on them actually doing a good job, only on their contacts and how good they are at pretending to do good job.<br>Taking a bad manager down takes a lot efforts, knowledge, courage and sacrifice on the part of their subordinates."
1318,"No matter the industry, QA is always treated with genuine contempt.<br>But what goes around, comes around.<br>And the circle of hatred spins ever faster.<br>The worst part: Everybody looses this way, the company, the employees and foremost the customers."
1319,if my boss said &quot;you can be replaced at any time&quot; I would have been among the first people to walk out. kudos to the team for doing just that.
1320,"Location based pay would probably be fine if the company actually did it.  You&#39;ll never catch them saying &quot;you get a 50% raise because of where you live&quot; though because it&#39;s not that they&#39;re doing location based pay, it&#39;s just an excuse to get you to stop complaining."
1321,"Worked @ Msft in 2010, they called us contractors ‚Äúdash trash‚Äù cause our emails had a -c in our names.<br><br>Totally understand the badge card color stuff"
1322,"Microsoft didn&#39;t buy Blizzard for the development talent, they bought them for the IP."
1323,"in Finland working day shift and night shift the difference is like 3,7 euros/hour (3,97 dollars). I would never even lift my finger for 0,5 cent (0,47 euro) to work only nights"
1324,This whole ‚Äúcan‚Äôt afford a lawyer‚Äù mentality is crazy to me. Most times you can‚Äôt afford not to get one. There are enough paralegals and newbies around to save a lot of people so much trouble for a reasonable fee.
1325,Thor naming the fucking testing bridge bifrost is so dope
1326,I bought 3 copies of Starcraft and broodwar just to support them. That was time when you know that out of respect you are not pirating blizz. And in Poland at this time it was a lot easier to get pirated versions of games. How far they have fallen.
1327,Duke Nukem Forever sucked because the original DN control was point and shoot or point and walk. DNF changed that to point and shoot or blindly walk.

But every act/bliz job i tried to get for QA had on the app &#39;must be gamer&#39;. Whatever that means."
1329,do your homework if you going to be spending more than an hour talking to a former blizz employee and not know who Mike Morhaime is.
1330,imagine having a learning disability and they fire you because you read too slow [the dream] ‚ñ∫  law suit.
1331,Ruby on rails catching strays out of no where
1332,Prime-Thor combo is epic teir
1333,If QA gets pushed to test stuff that isnt ready yet but never gets around to actually do their important work it kinda explains that Blizzard Games feel like they werent tested at all...if you treat QA this way it just means Blizzard has no interest to assure Quality...checks out

1341,"I&#39;m puzzled by the trend of labeling companies as inherently &quot;evil.&quot; This seems to reflect a broader issue of resilience, as discussed by Jonathan Haidt. There&#39;s a generational challenge at play, and as part of an earlier generation, I recognize our part in this. It&#39;s unclear how to address this without a time machine, but there appears to be a lack of initiative among younger millennials and subsequent generations. Despite my fondness for Blizzard, the criticisms, such as those by PritaeSoftware, suggest an expectation that large companies should be flawless. However, imperfections are common in any significant endeavor. The real question is why aren&#39;t younger generations building their own influential institutions and culture drivers, instead of being disillusioned with the ones they once idolized? This reminds me of a personal experience during the holidays, questioning why we, in our 40s, were still relying on our elderly mother to maintain traditions. It&#39;s a call to action for us to take responsibility. Similarly, why can&#39;t individuals disillusioned with corporate cultures start their own ventures that align with their values? It seems there&#39;s a widespread issue of stagnation, perhaps due to overindulgence and a lack of real-world experiences."

It had a really stupid feature of bases being protected by rocks. That does not help new players at all in my opinion. It teaches them the wrong way to play the game). More recently I realized that it would probably make sense for even low ranked players (the bottom 80-90% of players) to have everything revealed. But really it wouldn&#39;t be too unreasonable to even just have the whole game be revealed to both/all sides for <i>all</i> games‚Äî or at least a game mode to do this."

I have trained to do automation and implemented automation but they won&#39;t move me to either dev or QA Automation because I am &quot;too valuable&quot; to move from the current team.

I also know, from working in tech/software development in the UK, that it&#39;s actually quite rare that these contract terms are ever acted on. I&#39;ve watched my company poach from within the industry and watched co-workers leave directly to competitors. They just don&#39;t do it here. This makes me think it&#39;s just too hard to actually use those terms (that are in the contracts) against someone here.<br><br>But, having worked for US based multinationals, this idea that they can impose US employment rules outside of the US, and getting humbled pretty quickly isn&#39;t uncommon.

The games industry seems to be exceptionally plagued by unreasonable crap that is just figures above your pay grade. I don&#39;t know why this industry is so particularity toxic.

I was lucky though as the CEO was based as hell. He sided with me that my Twitter posts were mine alone. My twitter account could not be used to infer I worked for them. The woman from HR actually tried to argue that I should be fired. He was having none of it though. The HR woman &quot;left&quot; a few months later. I was lucky, but i bet a lot of others are not.

1435,"I worked at Activision as a QA tester for almost 3 years but decided to quit last August. At first the job was great, I started during the pandemic so work was fully remote, then they hired all the contractors as full time employees and gave us a raise to $20/hour. It was the best job I ever had...until it wasn&#39;t. Everything started going downhill right before the launch of MW2. Before moving to MW2 I was working on the post-launch of Cold War in the Central QA team which meant that we were more upstream from the rest of QA (i.e. we generally saw newer content before the rest of the team and tasking was more focused on ad-hoc testing/QA requests than checklist testing...which is really boring). Even though we had bug quotas, they never heavily enforced the quotas and it was fairly easy to meet the quota anyway since we were seeing new content earlier than the other teams and got to test a lot of different parts of the game.<br><br>Near the end of the project, most of us were moved to MW2 and I was moved to a publishing team (which was more downstream). It was great at first because it was exciting to work on a pre-launch title and our tasking was mostly &quot;go out and find some bugs&quot;. Then they moved us to separate teams that focused on different parts of the game. I was put on the single-player/co-op team which I was  happy with since I love testing single-player, and was open to co-op (though quickly grew to hate testing co-op...don&#39;t get me started on the raids lol). I figured they&#39;d keep us in the teams until shortly after post-launch and then they&#39;d bring the squads together so testers can work on other parts of the game and not get burned out. However, that never happened. We were all stuck working in those squads all the way up until I quit. But that wasn&#39;t the reason I quit, since I know every job has its shit.<br><br>A few months after being moved to MW2, they started HEAVILY enforcing the bug quotas. Where before they would only bring up the quotas during quarterly performance reviews, and even then they were mostly concerned with your bug count relative to the average bug count (so the expected bug quota average was 5 bugs/week but if the team averaged 3 bugs/per week they only wanted you to be at or above that number). Afterwards they started having weekly meetings with any tester that didn&#39;t meet the quota. Keep in mind that that we were downstream, so we weren&#39;t seeing new content as early as other teams. Also keep in mind that every time you found a bug, we had to record media and search for the bug on Jira to make sure that it wasn&#39;t already written, and all of that takes time. Sure, it&#39;s not a lot of time, but let&#39;s say it takes you 5 minutes to do that and you come across 10 different bugs that were already written that you didn&#39;t know about (because the content you&#39;re testing is new to you, but not to other teams), that&#39;s almost an hour of your time down the drain. Furthermore, we sometimes had multiple weeks where we wouldn&#39;t see any new content or even a new build of the game. Doubly furthermore, I was on the single-player/co-op team which has least frequency of new content. I know that I wasn&#39;t the best QA tester, but I also knew that I wasn&#39;t the worst, and it was really frustrating being called out multiple weeks for being &quot;bad at my job&quot; because I was spending more time looking for real issues rather than vomiting out multiple very minor art bugs that I knew wouldn&#39;t get fixed anyway. But that wasn&#39;t the reason I quit, since...I know every job has its shit.<br><br>A few months after that, during our weekly meeting they announced that everyone would be returning to office 3 days a week. No exceptions, not even for those with disabilities. I was already frustrated enough with trying to meet the bug quota while playing the same mode with the same 5 maps over and over again to squeeze every ounce of bug possible, let alone having someone looking over my shoulder while I do it (not to mention no longer having the opportunity to care of things at home, do things for my health, or develop my game during breaks). But I kept going with the job even though I started seeing the writing on the wall. Why? Because, well, every job has its...nevermind you get it lol.<br><br>Working in office did have some perks: my coworkers were great, we had a free lunch delivered to us, and there was an open snack bar with various means to ingest copious amounts of caffeine. But the cons heavily outweighed the pros: the office-politics, stupid policies that are enforced by execs that know nothing about our jobs, my ADHD brain trying to deal with blank-white walls and florescent lights without any open windows, and the detriment to my physical health and work-life balance (in fact I gained 50 pounds since I started working at Activision, 30 of which were gained after being moved to MW2. Thankfully I lost half of that since I quit and am much healthier). I was perpetually burned out. Even after taking a week or two off for vacation, I would come back and get burned out again within a couple days. Despite all that, I could have kept going if it wasn&#39;t for the Microsoft acquisition. I knew the acquisition was going to result in layoffs, and I wasn&#39;t confident I would make the cut. So I started to think about quitting and the idea bounced around in my head for a couple months until I finally did.<br><br>So why did I quit? Well, all of those reasons. When I started the job, I thought &quot;wow it seems like Activision execs are actually trying to turn some things around and make a better work place&quot;. But the remote work, full time hire, and pay raise were all smoke and mirrors to hide that the &quot;higher-ups&quot; still think QA is just as disposable as they always thought they did. At first I thought quitting was a huge mistake since finding new work has been extremely difficult, but after seeing the news of the layoffs and forcing employees to return to office 5 days a week, I know I made the right choice.<br><br>Anyways, thanks for coming to my TED talk lol"

1438,"I do remember the in house devs at a company I contracted at looking down on the &quot;test team&quot; which was the equivalent of QA there. It was appalling how they were treated, the devs would go out of there way to avoid providing any information that would help the test team do their job, in fact they&#39;d generally try and hide as much as they good to try and ensure the test team wouldn&#39;t find any issues because they wouldn&#39;t know what to test."

In theory it worked well so the public, &amp; visitors could identify (to a point) who they needed to look for, or ask, but with everything it was a double sided sword. Respiratory are usually black scrubs, OR have the pale blue scrubs, IR/Radiology have dark blue, etc. Pharmacy green, etc etc. But personally, I‚Äôve had doctors be interested in my opinions regarding patient care up until they glanced down at my badge and saw my title, you could instantly see the disconnection occur in their eyes. What‚Äôs worse is they would simply walk away as soon as it occurred, you could be mid word/sentence, and they up and leave."

If your any person and you see even one strange or wrong thing you mind says first why. As CEO he would have to never ever have asked why, and never questioned or had any kind of BS detector.

At the time our school was the only video game production focused school since it as a new thing. No one as interested in working at Blizzard. We would just ask them about all the negative rumors regarding how workers were treated. Not even our less talented students were interested. WC2, SC1 and SC2 was kinda cool, but I never understood why anyone thought working there would be a good idea. Even after WOW came out, I think by then everyone already knew Blizzard was a hellhole. Why were there so many people trying to work there?"

1547,"I know there are things like &quot;you shouldn&#39;t name names for your own sake&quot; and &quot;it&#39;s business, life is harsh&quot; etc but the people that did these things at Blizzard should be tarred and feathered for their behaviour, the very first stories of the people who got the night-shift QAs to do this loaded test and fired people for being the last to leave the room should be named and made into social pariahs, the Director who said everyone is replaceable during a morale boost should be persona-non-grata not just in the gaming industry but in all industries. If these people will flex their small amount of power over others at Blizzard like this, what are these people like if they get more social power?"
1548,"Most recent Blizzard BS I ran into (from the outside). I resubscribed for WoW, got my first month after getting the new expansion (Dragonflight), and then went to login and PATCH day. Yaaay. Normally this isn&#39;t too big a deal and you only lose a day, but this time around it was right after Blizzcon and something they did there caused the westcoast servers to slow down to nearly 12bytes pers second and log you out every hour or so. I spent a week in downloading patch hell. Contacted support and politely asked for imbursement of time, &quot;We don&#39;t do that anymore. If that were to happen, it&#39;d be up to the devs. You can leave a &quot;suggestion&quot; on the forums.&quot; Excuse me? Devs are in charge of time refunds for service interruptions that don&#39;t affect everyone? And why is it devs? And why is it on the forums where every Tom, Dick, and Harold can chime in? <br>Well, since I hadn&#39;t been able to login yet and use my newly purchased wow time, I asked if I can get a refund? &quot;Oh sure, we&#39;ll refund the entire month.&quot; <br> So instead of crediting me 3 days, they&#39;d rather refund my entire month. And since they created such a roadblock to get this far (we&#39;re talking 8-12 back and fourths using their in-game ticket system), I didn&#39;t resubscribe, even though that door was still open to me. <br>These are the kinds of dumb policy decisions that will inevitably cause Blizzard to dissolve over time. Taking away vested powers out of supports hands for issues, and having no way to report to higherups that significant problems are going on."
1549,One of the policies Microsoft is imposing on their Dev... is they want them to follow their product. They even have to do qa and deployment to staging and promote to prod. So the dev team has to follow through.

In an era where every other studio is firing half their staff, massively downsizing, we&#39;re recruiting and still insanely profitable. A huge part of why we&#39;re able to do that is that we&#39;ve let our senior talent go into roles where they continue to do what they are good at. Our senior programming staff is all people who&#39;ve been at the company for 15+ years at this point. Insanely brilliant people, they know everything about the company, and the people too.

I know thor and prime make it sounds like you can get it free or cheap, but you will always ends up needing to talk to them a couple of times and they might not always agree with your agreement. From personal experience, always get it early before things escalate then when things are bad."
1564,qa is the backbone of success
1565,"Good video, great insights"
1566,QA is an absolutely necessary system in producing a good product. But there is truth in saying I can get bunch of high school kids to do this. I never seen the general QA position as career.<br>There are aspects of QA in regards to software that certainly fall into the engineering realm but the average testers job not so much. 90+% I can test without a person even. I can have one system interface with another system and run all the keyboard and mouse inputs to hell and back. I can fully automate it playing the game. People tend to be good for finding the stuff you don&#39;t expect people to do.
1567,"Imagine living in a state where switchblades are illegal, lol."
1568,"holy hell, I&#39;m in rapid city, there are other dev&#39;s here?"
1569,"H.R. might not inherently be bad people, but you do have to have some level of capability for cruelty to be able to sit there and &#39;oh I totally understand your opinion, one hundred percent&#39; someone to their face....<br><br>It&#39;s not too far from how executioners were viewed - you&#39;d think any good person would be driven crazy by that kind of job, so even the &#39;good&#39; ones probably aren&#39;t good for long..."
1570,"wow big company bad, surpise"
1571,"I mean just look at the last few years of game and software product releases, clearly QA is treated like shit. What&#39;s insane is that good QA can do so much to save these stupid companies from all their stupid ass lack of planning and bad design decisions before anyone sees it and yet they still don&#39;t learn. But then again you would think keeping people in roles where they bring the most value should be a priority not moving up and out but that&#39;s still a problem everywhere now."
1572,piratesoftware is like the howard stern of the dev world
1573,Worked at Activision on the Warzone/Modern Warfare QA team; can confirm this is 100% the vibe at Acti-Blizz (pre-M$ buyout)
1574,You built what? that Bifrost anecdote for testing diablo on console alone is worth an entire interview
1575,:O the yt shorts therapist and average rust programmer in one video!
1576,D4 bad
1577,"Microsoft has done some bad stuff, but my god I hope they clean up management hardcore, preferably with electroshock weaponry, because... It&#39;s borderline crimes against humanity, if what is said is only 65% true"
1578,The read-the-whole thing gimmick is literally a middle/high school tactic for either substitute teachers or bored gym-coaches required to have that one &quot;teaching class they have to sit for. Combine with middle-mgmt approach of cut the &quot;bottom&quot; 10% and you&#39;ve got toxic gold.
1579,&#39;We&#39;ve crossed streams&#39; AHAHAHAHAHAHA
1580,+1 HR is for R ... just not the H.
1581,"Email Mike is probably a great tool. Imagine the manager of someone emailing Mike for some issue, I bet he will shit his pants"
1582,"HR always is there to protect the company from the employees and in some binine instances, they will help the employee, if it does not adversely affest the company. My problem is that the branding that HR often creates for their group is not communicating these facts and often manipulates employees into think the opposite. As Prime says, their is no way around this, HR will always be primarily concerned with the companies interests. Even if they created a second department that was there to advocate for the employee, at the end of the day, that department is still owned by the company and would never do anything outside the companies interest. Companies do not have sould or morals or ethics, outside of what laws and regulations are enforced upon them. The only advocate that the employee truly has is either themselves or a UNION or GUILD!!!!! The US has been brainwashed into thinking that Unions are something different from a collection of fellow workers, banding together to negotiate with company for a better life. The alternative is a bunch of individuals, negotiating for themselves with little to no leverage. Unless you are a one in a million superstar, you are expendable and have no leverage. If you make employing you an inconvenience, by wanting a fair wage or benefits, they will just cut you loose and who will fight for you then? HR?"
1583,Blizzard will end up in the most epic TheDailyWTF article ever at this rate.
1584,"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KGQSTDm5ois&amp;t=2640"">44:00</a> such an amazing idea. <br>Also, the &quot;offensive HR&quot; sound just like antibodies in the human system which kill malignant cells. <br>Or maybe the even better anology is the cells that train the human body - they kill off anything defective."
1585,i&#39;ve recently witnessed the &quot;QA getting ahead of dev&quot; thing... was confused as to why it was happening but realized there&#39;s just no leadership anywhere
1586,They literally made QA yellow and brown? Piss and shit?
1587,"This guy comes off as extremely full of shit. Bad vibes, I would stay away from this guy probably a pathological liar"
1588,"As a QA you can get ahead of development by reading designs, product roadmaps, etc... are you saying code needs to be there for a QA to start writting tests ? Assuming QAs are doing functional tests, they don&#39;t even need to see the code they&#39;re testing they just need to know what the outcome of running the code should look like."
1589,81 minutes for the history books.
1590,These are literally my 2 favorite creators! I need more of Prime x Thor!!
1591,"I‚Äôm from Montana and the Billings story totally checks out for the time<br><br>I‚Äôm in Bozeman, who is sushi dragon?!"
1592,"A lot of these business practices are illegal in other countries. For example, in the UK, HR depts are obliged to provide &#39;reasonable adjustments,&#39; for protected characteristics. When an employee has medical conditions, change in life circumstances or bereavement. It seems like if you&#39;re in the US, they can just fire you if you&#39;re too &#39;demanding&#39; of an employee."
1593,Pirate is actually not right about Ben Brode case. <br>1) Marvel Snap is a success just because it&#39;s Marvel. There are tens of thousands mobile card games made by passionate card game lovers and they make nothing (and will not make anything).<br>2) No other former Blizzard employee had any success such as this. So Ben Brode is actually exception.<br>3) Big studios buying small studios is EVIL! It breaks them. And MS - Blizzard deal is no different. People TOLD YOU this is how things will work out and they did. And now you act surprised. Literally all smart people told that MS deal was a HUGE mistake.
1594,wow blizarrd seems like such a trash fire of capitalistic company
1595,The thing that realy makes me happy is that Mike Morhain was not part of this shit and instead trying to be the good soul of the company. Because i always respected him and hoped he wasn&#39;t secretely a corporate asshole.

I can definitely win in a scenario like that. You may not like the ways, but there are always ways to win. Screw me out of my pay? No problem, I&#39;ll ensure you lose more than I did. The race to the bottom takes a level of constitution that most of the fragile sensitive egos in the software industry don&#39;t have the stomach for."

1605,QA is dev? depends...<br>if you&#39;re just doing manual testing and i have to help as a dev the QA tester to get his tests done (given i don&#39;t hold specialized knowledge to get the test done) then sorry no you&#39;re not a dev.<br>I&#39;ve yet to encounter a QA person like piratesoftware
1606,"Whenever I hear someone say &quot;HR is there to protect the company from you&quot;, I just feel like Rorschach in prison.<br><br>&quot;None of you seem to understand. I&#39;m not locked in here with you. YOU&#39;RE LOCKED IN HERE WITH ME!&quot;"
1607,HR is the devil and you can&#39;t change my mind
1608,Can you put the IRL stream with you guys? Id love to watch it.
1609,"&quot;oh so you try to re-read better and understand by taking a little more time? Bad QA. Real QA only do exactly what they are told. That&#39;s how you simulate having users, we all know users only follow pre-built bath&quot;"
1610,"I am 10 minutes in, and this is already one of the most cathartic things I&#39;ve ever listened to."

1612,"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KGQSTDm5ois&amp;t=3000"">50:00</a> I used to think location based pay was BS as well, until I thought about the eventuality of the situation. Take away location based pay, and then all wages become Vietnam or Argentina wages, where software devs make 5-10% of what they do in the USA. Would you take minimum wage to be a VP watching over a few hundred people? No? Well tough, that&#39;s what happens without location based pay."
1613,"Barcodes in starcraft might in some cases be cheaters, and certainly I&#39;ve not played a sc ladder game in awhile so i dont know the state of cheating in that game, but barcodes are a tradition for pros to obscure their identity to other players while practicing so the top of the ladder is always going to contain barcodes"
1614,I mean HR literally means human resources. it&#39;s in the title that employees are resources managed for the company. So of course they are here to protect the company not the resources.
1615,"This is a bizarro world being described here. Back in the 1980&#39;s when I worked on avionics, think Fly By Wire, the devs and the QA were all in the same boat. We all had to understand the same system and specs. One side to implement it, the other to verify it.  And I thought old UK was rife with class divisions."

The amount of abuse only increases exponentially from there."
1623,"Non competes are unenforceable in the UK. If you wish to enforce it you need to pay what is called &quot;garden leave&quot;. California also banned non competes from 1 Jan, 2024."

1625,&quot;Can&#39;t believe they did that to the guy that created Roller Coaster Tycoon&quot; LMAO<br>Had to do a double take as well verifying it wasn&#39;t THE ACTUAL Chris Sawyer name
1626,thank you for doing a stream with Pirate Software
1627,"I still think HR was wrong there. I mean, obviously everyone was wrong! but I mean even in the context of HR&#39;s role. HR needs to see a case like this and go &quot;we better get rid of this manager or we&#39;ll get sued to hell and back&quot;, which happened before and will probably happen again. And that flaw in HR enables more shithead behaviors to come."
1628,"I&#39;m sorry, I have a hard time cutting Mike Morhaim some slack. Things cannot get this bad without him knowing. And if they do, that doesn&#39;t speak very highly of him either."

1634,"Wild... the UK does recognize a concept called &quot;restrictive covenants&quot; in employment law, under which a former employee can be restricted from working.

1636,another alpha in it to subscribe on
1637,not to be a hater but &quot;career in QA &quot; is crazy
1638,commenting because I like the both of you
1639,"&quot;getting ahead of development&quot; it&#39;s like management heard about test driven development and were like, well, we&#39;re not gonna do fake agile like other industries, but we can at least bastardize this concept"

1644,People need to stop putting up with the shit treatment. They get away with it because people let them.
1645,The biggest mistake blizzard made was hiring someone who puts pronouns in their title.
1646,When I was in college back in 2004-2010 Blizzard was rumored/known to give very low starting salary for developer roles. One of many reason why I stopped caring about going into video game development especially so from &quot;AAA&quot; companies and time crunch development cycles.
1647,"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KGQSTDm5ois&amp;t=1331"">22:11</a> - Our company doesn‚Äôt have HR, it has FBI style ‚ÄúOffice of Professional Responsibility‚Äù. They have the duty to enforce professionalism in the company by employees, with a magnifying glass on officers of the company :)"
1648,"He should have made it as public as possible and gotten a lawyer IMMEDIATLY. This whole thing was so fucking illegal. He could have retired on the money he would have gotten. They would have paid him just to not fuck their deal with Microsoft. If he didn&#39;t get a promotion, where did the non compete even come from? Not to mention, LEADERSHIP is 100% a vertical promotion because you are ABOVE others in the responsibility chain. It is in the definition of the word. He should have sued them for fraud, extortion and emotional damages. EU law protects you a ton more than US law. I got 9 weeks paid for an hourly wage job."
1649,"I totally enjoyed playing WarCraft II, StarCraft, WarCraft III, and StarCraft 2.  It was shocking to discover just how horribly the company treated most of the people who worked so hard on games I loved."
1650,A smart developer befriends good QA talent to become a 10x-100x dev
1651,"Thor lulling me asleep with that nice baritone, the prime yapping like the monkey he is. Lovely. Always a good evening view"
1652,Prime is like the rest of us. He just wants to hear Thor speak.
1653,"I have a bachelor&#39;s degree in game design, have worked for game companies and also owned a small indie studio. And all I can say after spending years in game development: It sucks! It&#39;s a broken, unhealthy, destructive world. I would never go back in my life."

1663,"Amazing entertainment, thanks guys"
1664,Blizzard was fucking Guantanamo. What the fuck?!
1665,Psoft‚Äôs Blizz story is so upsetting
1666,"HR is about the management of human resources to benefit the company maximally.<br>Sometimes that means protecting the company by firing &#39;uppity&#39; employees complaining about management.<br>Other times it means helping you make a lateral move to a position you find more fulfilling or helping you upskill by providing or paying for training/courses. <br>It depends on the company culture, do they think content/happier employees to be more productive or do they think that undervalued, miserable employees do the same work as content/happier employees, and so tries to get them to do more work for the same pay."
1667,"Here&#39;s PirateSoftware&#39;s Twitch VOD ID: 2057606083, starts about seven hours in."
1668,Blizzard is dead.
1669,"if there ever I had any doubts about buying anything blizzard... there it goes, I will never buy anything again, screw M$ for buying a rotten company."
1670,honestly what an amazing collab. A joy to watch these two together.
1671,"Basically any good game or good studio was done under asshole managers and crunch.  Even Tim Cain has basically said crunch is necessary and if you want a good game then work life balance comes second. Bethesda crunched for years along with Naighty Dog, Epic games, and From Sodtware.<br><br>You want to know why games are bad now? Nope not woke or microtransactions or corporate."

1677,"High School is a reflection of terrible corporate structure. We need more companies with flat hierarchies like worker cooperatives, syndicates, and worker democracies."
1678,Two of my favorite dev streamers (the only ones I watch) in one video.
1679,So hard hearing how awful blizzard was when I loved their games so much back in the day.
1680,"My day job is a Web Developer, my hobby is game dev XD this is awesome."
1681,i know nothing about software but ngl QA does sound kinda gay
1682,This whole conversation at the end made me so happy
1683,TheSonicagen bringing us an amazing collab once again.
1684,"H1B is a non immigrant visa, its not meant as a come here and stay here forever sort of deal. Even a lot of the h1b visa we give we dont need to be giving out in a first place."
1685,glad i deleted all my blizzard sh*t a while back
1686,How much do people expect to earn by playing games? üòÇ everybody wants big titles. QA engineer or data scientist instead of a tester or spreadsheet analyst <br>Blizzard released one of the best games ever. SC and Diablo are some of my favourites and yes devs are the rockstars.
1687,How Blizzard hasn&#39;t been shut down yet is unbelievable and despicable
1688,"Reminds me of hospitality in a lot of ways I&#39;ve been trying to get back into working after taking a break to go to uni for software dev but to me working is 7 days a week 16 hours a day, and I know that isn&#39;t normal but it makes me scared of having a job again, I like actually being able to see my wife and go to family events etc. (we had to fight for any days off even for funerals etc.) and in my head that is what a job is like."
1689,"Sure microsoft will patch that brain drain, they will just do it abroad. Asian and eastern European workers are on average just as good on individual level. What you might miss is organisational advantages like culture, communication and efficient processes.<br><br>If blizzard lacked those advantages to begin with, then finding equally talented individuals with substantially lower standards and costs of living is just a matter of time.<br><br>Companies can get away with undervaluing gifted workers with wrong color of a badge. They can get away with a lot more when undervaluing gifted people with wrong color of a skintone and passport."
1690,is that the guy that yt shorts algo blow ?
1691,"Wow, I want to see more of these 2 guys talking, omg!"
1692,No one actually said it but both circled around it a lot. Art needs an auteur.
1693,"Blizzard is seriously one of the worst companies ever, why anyone would want to work there in the last decade is beyond me"
1694,"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KGQSTDm5ois&amp;t=405"">6:45</a> this is why tech workers need to unionise"
1695,"The &quot;no upgrade path&quot; has been a common problem not only for QA.<br><br>When I still worked in France, if you were a programmer or an artists and needed a raise (because of house, kids, whatever...) the only possibility was to switch to a management position, which means indeed that you lose a talented technician and you get a shitty (in most cases) manager.<br><br>Dumb dumb dumb system."
1696,"Okay, this is going in the Favorites playlist."
1697,As a European i am very certain that the behavior of Blizzard was illegal and violates labor laws. And i think Chris could still get the 3 months worth of salary.
1698,"In the 90s Blizzard may have been the standard, though I would have picked id Software for the time, but in 2009 when he started Valve Software was definitely the moonshot for game developers, and I would say it remains to this day, though they don&#39;t work nearly as much on games anymore."
1699,"I worked in a datacenter for a few years, on the night shift. a position on day shift opens up, I&#39;m offered the position, being what is basically second in command and handling double or triple the workload. I ask, does it come with a pay increase, since it is a lot more work? nope. I refuse. btw, in the 5 years I worked at this company, not even a single raise. I snap on my boss due to stress, I&#39;m called into a meeting with hr, and I finally got a good raise. a month or few later I&#39;m laid off, because I was paid better."
1700,now ill wait for the tsoding collab
1701,"What a great conversation about real world stuff in corporate culture. In a lot of these scenarios people are treated as commodities, and interchangeable. Its sad but its all too common."
1702,"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KGQSTDm5ois&amp;t=4300"">1:11:40</a> HR will protect you if it&#39;s not in conflict with protecting the company, but of <b>course</b> HR has to protect the company first and foremost. If HR was willing to burn down the whole company in order to stand up for one person, that would objectively be worse for more people."
1703,Meh. Every generation has had to &quot;pay your dues&quot; when breaking into any growth industry. Labor is a free market and people in the labor market get to say what is acceptable and what is not. And the WAY they &quot;say&quot; is by accepting positions (or not) and staying at those positions (or not).<br><br>Going from zero dollars per hour to $10 per hour is an infinity percent upgrade. And (as illustrated by the story shared here) the position obtained may lead to career advancement and class mobility.<br><br>Don&#39;t throw down behind you the very same ladders you yourself used to climb to higher heights.
1704,This is great üòÑ
